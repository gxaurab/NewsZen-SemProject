Ofcom: Clear link between online posts and violent disorder,"There was a ""clear connection"" between the violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland in the summer and posts on social media and messaging apps, Ofcom has concluded.The government had asked the media regulator to consider how illegal content and disinformation spread during the unrest.In anopen letter setting out its findings, Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said such content spread ""widely and quickly"" online following the stabbings in Southport, in July, which preceded the disorder.She added most online services took ""rapid action"", but said the responses of some firms were ""uneven"".""Posts about the Southport incident and subsequent events from high-profile accounts reached millions of users, demonstrating the role that virality and algorithmic recommendations can play in driving divisive narratives in a crisis period,"" Dame Melanie wrote.The BBC approached major tech platforms for their response to the letter.X, formerly Twitter, told BBC Newssome accounts were suspended and other content was removed from the platform following the riots.A spokesman from the messaging app Telegram said they ""immediately removed UK channels that called for violence as they were discovered in August"".None of the other major tech platforms responded to the BBC's request for comment.Experts say the unrest showed the power - and responsibility - social media platforms have.""Ofcom is saying that social media posts inciting riots are not just words - they play a big part in fanning the flames of disorder,"" said Rashik Parmar, from BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT.""There should be accountability where platforms allow dangerously divisive content to go unchecked,"" he added.Media analyst Hanna Kahlert, at Midia Research, said Ofcom's findings amounted to a ""call for social platforms to take greater ownership of the impact of content"".
Enhanced powers
At the time of the unrest, Ofcom faced criticism for not doing more to rein in the spread of untrue and inflammatory content.It urged tech firms to take action- but also pointed out the enhanced powers it is due to get under the Online Safety Act had not yet come into force.The act will see the creation of codes of practice for big tech firms which will place new responsibilities on them for tackling disinformation.""I am confident that, had the draft codes been in force at the time, they would have provided a firm basis for urgent engagement with services on the steps they were taking to protect UK users from harm,"" Dame Melanie wrote.She said the new powers set ""clear standards"" for what Ofcom would expect to see in future from big tech firms, such as:Specifying in their terms of service provisions how individuals are to be protected from priority illegal contentHaving systems designed to swiftly take down illegal content and having ""adequately resourced"" content moderation teamsProviding effective and accessible mechanisms for users to complain about illegal content, including on messaging platforms
The unrest which broke out in August this year was the worst that had been seen in the UK for a decade.It was followed bywaves of arrests and prosecutions, some for online offences.The role that big tech played was subject to much scrutiny - thoughthe platforms themselves remained largely silent at the time.The prime minister also got dragged into a war of words with one of the highest profile people in tech - X owner Elon Musk.The tech billionaire suggested that ""civil war is inevitable"" following the disorder.Sir Keir Starmer hit back saying there was ""no justification"" for Mr Musk's comments, adding there was more that social media companies ""can and should be doing"".A spokesman from X told the BBC: ""X monitored the platform and actioned thousands of pieces of content as part of our internal incident response protocols.""The X spokesman said some accounts were suspended and other content was removed, but they didn’t specify any more details.The spokesman also highlighted the role of community notes. He said this ""played an important role in addressing misleading content across the platform in relation to the incidents and these have been viewed millions of times""."
US warns Musk political group that $1m voter giveaway may be illegal,"A letter sent to Elon Musk's political action committee from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) warned that his lottery-style giveaway of $1m per day to a registered voter may be illegal, according to US media.Mr Musk, who is the world's richest man, actively campaigns for Republican Donald Trump in his presidential bid against Kamala Harris.Over the weekend, the owner of Tesla and X/Twitter began giving away prizes to American voters who signed a petition.It's unclear when the DOJ letter was sent to Mr Musk's organisation, America PAC. DOJ investigators have declined to comment on the case.
US outlets, including CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported on Wednesday that the letter informed Musk's team that the giveaway may violate federal election laws.It was sent by the DOJ's Public Integrity Section following outrage from Democrats over the cash stunt.Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?Under US law, it is illegal to pay people to register to vote. But it remains unclear whether the sweepstakes breaks any laws.Mr Musk's contest offers money to signatories of a petition, which the PAC circulated.“We want to try to get over a million, maybe 2 million voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment,” Mr Musk said in Pennsylvania on Saturday when he announced the event.The contest rules state that winners must be registered to vote, but no party affiliation is required.“We are going to be awarding $1 million (£770,000) randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election,” he said.The America PAC website states the goal is getting “1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms”.It is open to voters in seven swing states - Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. US election day is 5 November.
On Tuesday, a group of Republican ex-prosecutors wrote to the DOJ urging officials to investigate the contest.""We are aware of nothing like this in modern political history,"" they wrote, pointing to potential federal and state law violations.""Law enforcement agencies are appropriately reluctant to take action shortly before elections that could affect how people vote. But serious questions arising under laws that directly regulate the voting process must be an exception.""Mr Musk previously dismissed claims that the contest is illegal, saying: ""You can be from any or no political party, and you don’t even have to vote.""On Sunday, the contest reframed its rules, describing the money as payment for a job, according to CNN.America PAC said the winner will be “selected to earn $1M as a spokesperson for America PAC”. Winners have gone on to film pro-Trump videos.
Several legal experts have told the BBC that they believe the contest may be illegal.""His offer is only open to registered voters, so I think his offer runs afoul of this provision,"" said Paul Schiff Berman, a law professor at the George Washington University.He pointed to the US Code on electoral law, which states that anyone who ""pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting"" faces a potential $10,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence.Adav Noti of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center said Mr Musk's scheme ""violates federal law and is subject to civil or criminal enforcement by the Department of Justice"".""It is illegal to give out money on the condition that recipients register as voters,"" Mr Noti told the BBC.But Jeremy Paul, who teaches law at Northeastern University, said that Mr Musk may have found a legal loophole.He said that, while there is an argument that the offer could be illegal, it is “targeted and designed to get around what’s supposed to be the law"" and he believes the case would be difficult to make in court.

Trump has the world’s richest man on his side. What does Musk want?,"Zander Mundy was midway through a typical day at his office when he heard the news: tech billionaire Elon Musk was speaking at a nearby school in the town of Folsom, in the US state of Pennsylvania.""When is the richest guy in the world in town often?"" Mr Mundy remembers thinking to himself.With a population of just under 9,000 people, Folsom is a quiet place. Residents typically shy away from speaking openly about their politics, and political yard signs are few and far between.The 21-year-old Mr Mundy, who works at a leasing agent at an apartment complex, admits that he wasn't planning on voting in the November election.But once he saw crowds forming - and felt the excitement - he decided to go in, eager to hear from Musk.By the time he left the school, he recalls leaning more towards Donald Trump than towards Kamala Harris.""[If] someone like that tells you this is the election that's going to decide our future, not only who's president for the next four years but what the world world is going to be like... I think that's pretty huge,"" he told the BBC. ""That matters. That's significant.""Musk, who previously cultivated an image as an eccentric tech genius who was only on the sidelines of politics, has now pledged full allegiance to Trump.In full view of the American public, the 53-year-old has invested his time, operational know-how and ample pocketbook into trying to get the Republican elected - a rarity among the nation's business elite who traditionally prefer to influence politics from behind the scenes.It's an approach that is starkly different to traditional CEOs, many of whom have been better known for holding expensive, exclusive fundraising dinners or hosting potential donors at lavish homes in the Hamptons.And it's prompted observers to ask questions about Mr Musk's motivations.Follow live updates from the US campaign trailElection polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?The traditional approach by CEOs is ""not out in the public spotlight,"" explains Erik Gordon, chair of the entrepreneurship department at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. But ""Musk does it loudly and proudly, and, therefore, perhaps makes himself a lightning rod"".Musk's Trump-supporting political action committee - America PAC - has already spent more than $119m (£91.6m) this election cycle, according to Open Secrets, a non-profit tracker.Additionally, Musk's own contributions make him one of the largest individual donors in the presidential race, and reportedly play a vital role in Trump's door-knocking and ground operation in key swing states in which the campaign hopes to mobilise voters.Steve Davis, a key lieutenant of Musk's who has worked for his companies including SpaceX, X and the Boring Company, has reportedly been recruited to help in the effort.
Mr Musk's personal investment into the campaign is something that was quickly noticed by Mr Mundy.""That alone was shocking to me,"" he said. ""That someone would really spend that much time and money to influence voters. That means he's doing it for a reason.""Some Democrats, like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, have been urging their party to not ignore the threat Mr Musk poses ahead of the election.Mr Musk appeals to a demographic of people who see him as ""undeniably brilliant"" and among whom traditional Democratic outreach efforts have proven difficult, Fetterman believes.Why Trump is courting old friends from the WWEAre Elon Musk's election giveaways legal?Since first endorsing Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, Mr Musk has become a common fixture on the campaign trail, where he often delivers warnings that only Trump can ""save"" American democracy.In the closing days of the race, Mr Musk has criss-crossed the state of Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that has become a focus for Trump and Kamala Harris alike.America PAC is now doling out $1m a day until election day to one random voter - no matter their party affiliation - provided they have registered to vote and sign a petition.At ""town hall"" events in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh over the weekend, for example, Mr Musk presented giant lottery-style cheques to winners, with enthusiastic crowds chanting ""Elon"". He responded by telling the crowd that their energy ""lights a fire"" in his soul.At a rally in Philadelphia on Monday, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Mr Musk was “dangling a million bucks to many of us who are struggling to make ends meet, if they dance for him"".“Elon Musk thinks that dangling money in front of a working person is a cute thing to do when the election of our lives is before us because that’s what people and billionaires like that do,"" she added.Some observers, however, have questioned his motivation and have suggested that Mr Musk and his businesses stand to benefit from a relationship with Trump.Among those observers is Matt Teske, the CEO of electric vehicle charging platform Chargeway.According to Mr Teske, Mr Musk's political shift has been difficult for many in the electric vehicle industry, but comes as no surprise after several years of becoming increasingly active in politics.""I think Musk's interests are focused, predominantly, around a handful of things that are important to him related to his businesses, [with] regulation being something he's voiced concerns around,"" Mr Teske says. He notes that Mr Musk ""pushed back heavily"" on restrictions implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic in California.
The University of Michigan's Professor Gordon agrees. He says Mr Musk sees himself as a someone who has been held back by regulators, and feels that government intervention has stifled the development of the technologies he is focused on, such as autonomous driving.""He wants to be sort of on the frontier, [a] wild and woolly entrepreneur who can break new paths and not be bogged down by regulation, which tends to fall five, 10, 20 years behind advances in technology,"" Prof Gordon says.""Musk wants to go the other way,"" he adds. ""He wants to go to Mars.""If he wins in November, Donald Trump has suggested that Mr Musk could oversee ""cost cutting"" in the US government. Even if he doesn't do that exact job, Mr Musk would have Trump's ear thanks to his support during the campaign, observers believe, and he could have a strong influence on the administration's decision-making.Mr Musk, for his part, has said he would be open to the idea of leading a ""department of government efficiency"" to end regulation's ""strangulation"" of the US.That position, Democrats say, could present a complex conflict of interest, given the billions in government contracts Mr Musk has received for SpaceX and Tesla.""That's kind of deeply both unethical and illegal,"" says Lenny Mendonca, California Governor Gavin Newsom's former chief economic and business adviser.Mendonca believes that those with intertwined government and regulatory relationships ""can have a voice"" but should not be in a position of authority over those same interests.Lawrence Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, has questioned the legality of Mr Musk's giveaways in the election cycle.Mr Noble believes that this form of campaigning should concern Americans who value safe work environments and consumer protections.“We know what companies do when left to their own devices. They put profit and stockholder value and CEO compensation above safety, and they kind of write off the safety issues as a cost of doing business,” he tells the BBC.""It's dangerous to have somebody who views business that way, and views government that way, in charge of safety,"" he adds.For Mr Musk -  who relishes being a ""disrupter"" and renegade - there's little question that his lucrative relationships with the US government will continue, no matter the result of the November election.But his brand, and his reputation, are now tied to Donald Trump's - and his actions suggest he knows it.Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial

Facebook and Instagram launch celebrity scam ad crackdown,"Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is to introduce facial recognition technology to try and crack down on scammers who fraudulently use celebrities in adverts.Elon Musk and personal finance expert, Martin Lewis, are among those to fall victim to such scams, which typically promote investment schemes and crypto-currencies.Mr Lewis previously told the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4, that he receives ""countless"" reports of his name and face being used in such scams every day, and had been left feeling ""sick"" by them.Meta already uses an ad review system which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect fake celebrity endorsements but is now seeking to beef it up with facial recognition tech.It will work by comparing images from ads flagged as being dubious with celebrities' Facebook or Instagram profile photos.If the image is a confirmed to be a match, and the ad a scam, it will be automatically deleted.Meta said ""early testing"" of the system had shown ""promising results"" so it would now start showing in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who had been impacted by so-called ""celeb-bait.""
Deepfakes
The problem of celebrity scams has been a long-running one for Meta.It became so significant in the 2010s that Mr Lewis took legal action against Facebook, but he ultimately dropped the case when the tech giantagreed to introduce a button so people could report scam ads.In addition to introducing the button, Facebook also agreed to donate £3m to Citizens Advice.But, since then, the scams have become more complex and significantly more believable.They are increasingly powered by so-called deepfake technology, where a realistic computer-generated likeness or video is used to make it seem like the celebrity is backing a product or service.Meta has faced pressure to do something about the growing threat of these ads.On Sunday,Mr Lewis urged the governmentto give the UK regulator, Ofcom, more powers to tackle scam ads after a fake interview with Chancellor Rachel Reeves was used to trick people into giving away their bank details.""Scammers are relentless and continuously evolve their tactics to try to evade detection,"" Meta acknowledged.""We hope that by sharing our approach, we can help inform our industry’s defences against online scammers,"" it added.
Social media
Meta has also announced it will also use facial recognition tech to help people who find themselves locked out of their social media.Currently, unlocking Instagram or Facebook accounts involves uploading official ID or documents.But now video selfies and face recognition is being tested as a way to prove who a person is and and regain access more quickly.The material provided by the user will be checked against the account's profile image to see if it is a match.However, the widespread use of facial recognition is controversial - Facebook has previously used it, beforeditching it in 2021over privacy, accuracy and bias concerns.It now says that the video selfies will be encrypted and stored securely, and won't be shown publicly. Facial data generated in making the comparison will be deleted after the check.But the system will not be initially offered in areas where permission from regulators has not yet been obtained, including the UK and EU."
AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?,"Artificial intelligence is being used to generate paintings, images and even sculptures, with some selling for thousands of dollars. Do we need to reframe our definition of art?
In the drawing room of a stately home in rural Oxfordshire, I watch on as a dungaree-clad artist slowly and deliberately puts pen to paper. Her arm moves across the canvas, the marks gradually coalescing into an abstract portrait of herself.
It seems like a moment of creative expression. But this is no ordinary artist – she is the world's first humanoid robot artist, Ai-Da. By design, her very existence brings into question how we define art, and who, or in this case, what, can create it.
Will AI algorithms and robots like Ai-Da spell the end of human creativity and artistry, or can they be harnessed to augment our own creative potential?
Art in flux
When Marcel Duchamp proposed thata porcelain urinal be considered artand submitted it for exhibition in early 20th-Century New York, he flipped the art world on its head. He argued that anything could be considered as art, if chosen by the artist and labelled as such. It was a profoundly revolutionary thought which challenged previous notions of art as beautiful, technically skilful and emotive.
In much the same way, AI-created artworks are disrupting the accepted norms of the art world. As philosopher Alice Helliwell from Northeastern University London argues, if we can consider radical and divergent pieces like Duchamp's urinal and Tracey Emin's bed as art proper, how can something created by a generative algorithm be dismissed? After all, both were controversial at the time and contain objects that haven't technically been created by an ""artist's"" hand.
""Historically, the way we understand the definition of art has shifted,"" says Heliwell. ""It is hard to see why a urinal can be art, but art made by a generative algorithm could not be.""
Throughout history, every radical artistic movement has been intimately connected to the cultural zeitgeist of the time, a reflection of society's preoccupations and concerns, like Turner and his industrial landscapes and Da Vinci's obsession with science and mathematics. AI is no different. Ai-Da's creators, gallerist Aidan Meller and researcher Lucy Seal cite this as a pivotal reason for the existence of a humanoid artist like Ai-Da. She is the personification of one of contemporary society's current fears, the rise of job-snatching AI algorithms and potential robot domination.
But technological revolutions like artificial intelligence need not signify the ""end of art"" as many fear. Instead, they can help to kickstart an artistic metamorphosis and move us towards totally different ways of seeing and creating, something Marcus du Sautoy, a mathematician at the University of Oxford and author ofThe Creativity Code: Art and Innovation in the Age of AI, would contend.
Humans are just as prone to behaving like machines, repeating old behaviours and getting bogged down with rules, like a painter or musician locked into a particular style. ""AI might help us to stop behaving like machines…and kick us into being creative again as humans,"" says du Sautoy. He sees it as a powerful collaborator in the pursuit of human creativity.
There is historical precedence for new technology liberating us from our creative shackles. Take the invention of photography in the 1800s for example. Some artists saw the camera as the antithesis of an artist, and photographs as the mortal enemy of the art establishment.
But instead of replacing painting, photography became a catalyst in the development of the experimental modern art movement of the 20th Century, as artists moved away from realism towards abstraction, a shift that paved the way for the contemporary art of today.
Who's the artist?
Walking around Ai-Da's country pile in Oxfordshire I got to appreciate the sheer breadth of her artworks to-date. Unsettling busts of herself with her eyes stapled shut, scarab beetles fused to her face; partial and ethereal depictions of computer scientist Alan Turing; and colourful pop-art inspired portraits of Glastonbury headliners.
Unlike the numeroustext-to-image generatorslike Dall-E and Midjourney that have the ability to create alarmingly plausible magazine front covers andwin coveted art competitions, Ai-Da's artistic process doesn't rely solely upon thedata on which she has been trained. (Find out more about AI training in this simple guide to machine learning.)
Ai-Da also makes use of the cameras in her eyes, which feed novel images into her algorithm, thereby creating new and unique works far removed from human-generated datasets. This is how she's able to create self-portraiture. Does this make her creative in her own right? And can we credit her with authorship, or does this reside with the artists upon whose work she's been trained and with the creators of her algorithm, who ultimately wrote her code?
Margaret Boden, a researcher in cognitive science at the University of Sussex in the UK, has developed one of the mostwidely accepted definitions of creativity to date. She sees it as the ability to generate ideas that are new, valuable and surprising. Using this definition, the works produced by machines like Ai-Da could be considered creative, argue her creators. Whether or not an algorithm or a robot itself can be described as a creative entity, an 'artist' in its own right, like a human, remains up for debate, and this in part comes down to authorship.
Questions of authorship and data ownership plague the artificial intelligence narrative. Artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, who recently held anexhibition exploring collaborative artwork in the age of AIat London's Serpentine Gallery, want to confront the issue of data misuse and authorship in AI. The pair co-founded Spawning AI, a suite of tools aimed at empowering human creators to both prohibit AI from using their works and to find whether works of theirs have already been referenced in AI generated work.
Plagiarism is alegitimate concern for many artistsas their work is used to train algorithms but also can then becopied in the works that generative AI tools produce.
But there are also artists who see AI as a new outlet for their own creativity – a fresh medium they can wield much like a brush or palette knife. Some artists, such asSougwen Chung, are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries.
There is another argument at the heart of this issue too. The machine-learning processes used to train generative AI algorithms may be a creative process in themselves.
""Code exposed to data – existing artworks, for example – is able to learn, mutate and evolve,"" says du Sautoy. ""It means that the code by the end of this learning process is very different from the original code written by the human. This means that there is a chance for the code to produce something that... deserves to be called the creativity of the code rather than the human who started the process.
""It's a bit like Picasso is made from the DNA of his parents but it is his learning and exposure to the world that resulted in his creativity. You would never credit that to the parents even though everything started with their code or DNA."" (Learn more about machine learning and some of the other terms you need to understand AI better.)
Powerful algorithms calledCreative Adversarial Networks(Cans) also now exist, designed to deliberately create something that goes against the patterns in the training data, breaking with the style of the art upon which it's been trained. This is leading to AIs that generate very surprising results. ""Many machine learning algorithms are 'black boxes',"" says Helliwell. ""We do not fully know what is happening inside the system, even if we have designed it ourselves.""
This is a common and unsettling problem throughout the AI world. How can we trust the decisions or outputs from an AI if we don't understand how it got there in the first place? (Read more about why humans may never understand AI.)
Is art uniquely human?
The prospect of truly artistic machines is also challenging another long-held belief about what makes us human. Art has long been seen as a uniquely human endeavour. Made by humans, for aesthetic appreciation by other humans, artworks themselves are imbued with the emotions of their creators. It is a visual representation of their desires and fears, frustrations and reverence, or at the very least their need to create for practical, economical and emotional reasons.
So, can we consider the creations of non-human entities to be art by the same definition? There are some who believe thatanimals already produce forms of art. And research has shown that pigeons seem to be able todiscriminate between different types of artwork.
It all comes down to intent, this is ""what truly distinguishes the creativity of the human and the machine"", says du Sautoy. ""No machine is driven to express itself creatively. It is prompted by the intention of the human.""
Does this mean AI is not yet fully capable of creating true art? After all, computer algorithms lack any real-world experience and robots like Ai-Da, although capable of self-portraiture, don't actually possess self-awareness. This question remains hotly contested. For Helliwell a lack of intent shouldn't necessarily preclude AI works from being considered art.
More like this:
And perhaps that is what it comes down to. Art, goes the idiom, is in the eye of the beholder. As humans, for example, we identify patterns and admire the artistry evident in the natural world – the intricate web of a spider, the decorative plumage of a peacock. We often refer to bird calls as music and the mating displays of some animals as dance. There arenumerous examples of animals exhibiting creative behaviours that we might label artistic. The Bower bird and pufferfish play with perspective, symmetry and colour in much the same way a human artist might, for example. And while these animals may not necessarily be intentionally creating these to be enjoyed as works of art, their actions are no less intentional in their pursuit of attracting a mate or warding off competitors.
What's the future?
However we look to define art or the artist, it's clear that AI algorithms and machines like Ai-Da are having an impact on the art world. Their works areexhibitedalongside more traditional forms of art in established art institutions worldwide. Next year we'll see the world's firstAI art gallery open its doors in LA, a permanent exhibition space for ""ethical AI"".
Eva Jäger, the creative AI lead and arts technologies curator at the Serpentine Gallery in London, is also helping to bring AI art to the masses, with a programme of exhibitions provoking critical discussion about the impact of technology on art.
For her, the future of AI art is not adversarial. Traditional forms of art will continue to exist, just as AI artwork will continue to develop. She sees the collaboration between human and machine as a space for real creative potential. She believes that the artist's intent and the human practice behind a piece or installation which utilises technology like AI are more important than just the final aesthetics.
""For me there are some really interesting generative images that get produced, but without the practice behind it I'm not sold on them, just because they're an amazing image,"" she says. ""And I would say the same about painting. I’m much more interested in the systems, including the humans behind the work. I want to know what they are using the system for, what are they exploring? It's a mistake just to look at the final artefact.""
And when it comes to evaluating the authenticity and credibility of AI art, one of the most contentious aspects of the AI art discipline, du Sautoy makes a compelling point. All art is a product of that which came before it, and creativity cannot come from nothing – all artists whether human, robot or algorithm, build upon the works of others.
""Too many people discuss creativity as if it is some uniquely human magical process, that it conjures something from nothing like a magician,"" says du Sautoy. ""But that is just because we don't understand our own creativity.""

The weird history of the barcode,"Few people think twice about the barcodes on their shopping, but in the 75 years since they were first dreamed up, they have helped save lives, gone into space and stoked fears of the Antichrist.
Lasers. That's what supermarket staff need, insisted Paul McEnroe. Scanners in the checkout and little pistol-shaped laser guns, too. Point, shoot, sell!
In 1969, it was an outlandish vision of the future: these lasers would scan weird little black-and-white markings on products that McEnroe and his colleagues at IBM had designed. It would speed up supermarket queues, he enthused. The solution would come to be known as the barcode.
At this point in history barcodes had never been used commercially – though the idea had been brewing for decades following apatent filed on 20 October 1949by one of the engineers who was now part of McEnroe's team. The IBM engineers were trying to bring barcodes to life. They had a vision of the future where shoppers whizzed through the checkout with lasers scanning every item they wanted to purchase. But IBM's lawyers had a problem with the future.
""No way,"" they said, according to McEnroe, a now-retired engineer. Their fear was ""laser suicide"". What if people intentionally injured their eyes with the scanners and then sued IBM? What if supermarket staff went blind?
No, no, this was a mere half-milliwatt laser beam, McEnroe tried to explain. There was 12,000 times more energy in a 60-watt lightbulb. His pleas fell flat. And so he turned to Rhesus monkeys imported from Africa, though now he can't remember how many. ""I think it was six,"" he says. ""I couldn't swear to that."" After tests at a nearby laboratory proved that exposure to the tiny laser did not harm the animals' eyes, the lawyers relented.
And that is how the scanning of barcodesbecame commonplacein supermarkets across the US, and ultimately the entire world.
In an unexpected twist, the laboratory used by McEnroe subsequently told him it would be sending him the monkeys. They were his problem now. ""It was crazy,"" he recalls, laughing. ""I found a zoo in North Carolina.""
Alongside the monkeys, each human member of McEnroe's team at IBM also deserves credit for the Universal Product Code (UPC), as their version of the barcode became formally known. Among their number was Joe Woodland, the engineer who dreamed up the early concept behind barcodes decades earlier, afterdrawing lines in the sand on a beach. It was he and another engineer who made the application to patent the fundamental idea for barcodes back in October 1949.
Crucially,George Laurerand other members of the IBM team then took this pre-existing proposal for barcode-style markings and developed them into a neat rectangle of black, vertical lines corresponding to a number that could uniquely identify any supermarket item imaginable. From tins of soup to boxes of cereal or packets of spaghetti. The grocery industry formally adopted the UPC in 1973 and the first product bearing one wasscanned at Marsh Supermarket in Ohioin 1974. From there, it conquered the planet.
Other kinds of barcode soon followed and the UPC also laid the foundations for so-called ""2D barcodes"" such as QR codes, which can encode even more information. But the history of these little black-and-white markings is far wilder and rockier than you would ever imagine.
You could even argue that it began with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
""I was scanning things for the CIA,"" explains McEnroe. ""Great big maps."" That was one of his first jobs at IBM, involving image scanners. As he explains inhis book about the invention of the UPC barcode, this helped to prepare him for working on completely new, but related, technology that would revolutionise the retail industry.
McEnroe knew that checkout lines in stores would move much more quickly if staff could just scan products into a computer rather than having to read the prices stamped on each item and then manually process the sale. To be accepted, such a code-scanning system would have to work pretty much every time – and read the code correctly even if the product was pulled across the scanner at speeds of up to 100 inches per second (2.5m/s).
The IBM team set to work, drawing on the design patented by Woodland and his colleague – however, with an important difference. The original approach relied on reading the thickness of the black lines. One of the concepts they had proposed in the patent – a round, bulls-eye style barcode formed of concentric circles – had even been developed by a competing group. But this had proven difficult to print and even harder to fit neatly onto product packaging.
The IBM team worked out that it was easier to print vertical lines and base the scanning process not on measuring the thickness of those lines but rather the distance between the leading edge of one line and the leading edge of the line next to it. In other words, the space between the lines, which was more reflective and easier to pick up by the scanner. That way, it didn't matter if the label printer had too much ink and drew lines that were thicker than intended – the scan would still work, pretty much every time.
While the first barcode-branded product wassold in a US supermarket in 1974, it took another five years for barcodes to reach British supermarkets. As soon as they did, the first item to be scanned there wasa box of teabags.
McEnroe stresses that the launch of UPC barcode technology was not without controversy. ""Our first store didn't open,"" he recalls. There were people outside protesting the fact that prices would no longer be stamped on every product, merely on the shelves where products were placed in-store.
Some labour unions at the time felt – ultimately, correctly – that scanning technology threatened certain supermarket jobs. There were also concerns that barcodes could be used to obfuscate prices. McEnroe himself remembers how, in the past, shoppers sometimes searched for aging items in a supermarket since those ones might still have an older, lower price stamped on them. If barcodes took over, opportunities for such bargain-hunting would disappear.
These worries soon fizzled out. But barcodes have always upset some people.
To a fanatical few, they are nothing short of evil. In 2023, Jordan Frith, a professor of communication at Clemson University in South Carolina, publisheda book about the history of barcodes. During his research, he found a 1975 article in a publication called Gospel Call that suggested barcodes could be ""the Mark of the Beast"" – a reference to a biblical prophecy from the Book of Revelation about the end of the world. The New Testament passage in question refers to a beast – sometimes interpreted as the Antichrist – that forces every person to be marked on their right hand or forehead. In the prophecy, only those who accept such a mark are allowed to buy or sell.
The 1975 article suggested that, eventually, barcodes would be ""laser tattooed"" onto everybody's forehead or the back of their hand, ready for presentation at supermarket checkouts.
Although bizarre, the idea has proved surprisingly sticky. A 1982 book called The New Money System by evangelical writer Mary Stewart Relfe further popularised the supposed connection between UPC barcodes and the Mark of the Beast after she claimed the number 666 was ""hidden"" within the lines at either end and the middle of each barcode.
In fact, these ""guard lines"", as they are known, serve as a reference point to help the laser scanner pick out the start and end of each UPC sequence. Laurer in the IBM team, considered co-inventor of the UPC, later insistedthere was nothing sinister about thisand the resemblance to the pattern used to encode the number six was a coincidence.
But the bizarre theory can still be found in certain corners of the Internet. And some even take extreme steps to avoid barcodes, including members of an orthodox Russian Christian group known as Old Believers. One such Old Believer, Agafia Lykov, who lives in an especially remote part of Siberia,told visiting journalists from Vice in 2013that barcodes were ""the stamp of the Antichrist"". She added that if anyone gives her something, such as a packet of seeds, with a barcode on it, she takes the contents out and burns the packet.
Plus, in 2014, a Russian dairy company posted a statement on its website explaining why there wasa red cross printed over the barcodeson its cartons of milk. Because, as is ""well known"", the statement read, barcodes are the Mark of the Beast. The statement has since been removed from the company's website.
McEnroe says he is aware of some of these strange beliefs around barcodes. ""It's not something I would be prone to think,"" he says, rather diplomatically. Frith makes another point: ""It's kind of strange to imagine a bunch of grocery executives leading the way for the apocalypse.""
And yet there is, arguably, something strangely dystopian about barcodes. For some, they have become symbols of capitalism in its coldest form. They also often turn up in chilling sequences in movies. In The Terminator, we learn that prisoners of killer robots in an apocalyptic future receive barcode markings on their arms for identification. ""This is burned in by laser scan,"" time-travelling protagonist Kyle Reese explains to a terrified Sarah Connor. ""Some of us were kept alive to work – loading bodies."" The barcode marking, in this context, has echoes of the numberstattooed on the arms of Nazi concentration camp prisonersduring the Second World War.
Sometimes people do use barcodes malevolently. Especially when it comes to QR codes, which rather than using vertical lines consist of constellations of tiny black and white squares in a pattern that is readable by digital smartphone cameras.
Because scanning a QR code with your phone can direct your device to a malicious website, for example, QR codes have occasionally been deployed by hackers. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre haswarned members of the public to be wary about QR codes. Drivers in severalEnglish townshave also been warned about a scam wherefake QR codes were stuck to car parking machinesinan attempt to steal money from unwitting motorists. One code used in car parks in Leicester was evenlinked to Russia.
And, in September, Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollahaccused Israel of dropping leafletscontaining a dangerous barcode, referred to in some reports as a QR code, that could ""withdraw all information"" from any device used to scan it. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.
Despite some nefarious uses of barcodes, and outlandish claims that they represent the Mark of the Beast, these markings now underpin thousands of industrial and commercial processes all over the world. Anestimated 10 billion barcodes are scanned globally, every day, according to GS1, the organisation that oversees UPC and QR code standards.
You might have noticed the barcodes and QR codes on the packaging of items you receive in the post, for example. A single packet can be scanned many times on its journey from warehouse to you, says Frith. And because barcodes allow retailers to keep track of huge product inventories, that means these businesses can operate giant stores with relatively few staff. ""You wouldn't have these superstores or anything like that without barcodes,"" says Frith. ""It's changed the physical shape of retail.""
Erin Temmen, an account manager at labelling firm Electronic Imaging Materials, agrees with this assessment. Her company, like some others in the industry, produce barcode labels that will work in practically any environment. This includes cold-resistant labels that won't fall off equipment filled with liquid nitrogen, for example. And chemical-resistant labels that will retain their barcode even if they get splashed with nasty substances in a laboratory. The firm also produces extra reflective barcode labels. ""That increases the scan distance,"" says Temmen. It makes it easier for hurried workers to scan the code at a distance of up to 45ft (14m), making it detectable even if the barcode is on an item placed high on a shelf, for example.
Such versatility hints at the wide variety of contexts in which barcodes are actually used. They have helped to track thebehaviour and movement of honeybeesandsongbirds, taggedeggs and embryos in fertility clinicsto avoid mix-ups, and been placedon gravestonesto direct visitors to online memorials for the deceased.
The US military also uses barcodes to help ittrack the attendance and training of personnel. One University in Saudi Arabia also piloted using barcodes torecord student attendanceat lectures.
Barcodes have even made it into space. Astronauts on the International Space Station use barcode scanners toidentify equipment and mechanical parts, although they have largely been replaced with radio frequency (RFID) tags now. Barcodes are also employed to logthe food and beverage intakeby astronauts, as well as to identify theirblood, saliva and urine samples.
Back on Earth, it's possible that barcodes have saved lives. Hospitals use barcoding systems to track blood samples, drugs and medical devices such as hip replacements. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has aScan4Safety programme, to promote the use of barcodes for tracking such things. Machine-assisted identification can help staff ensure clinicians administer the correct drug to the correct patient, for example.
According to a report on Scan4Safety, the introduction of this technology has freed up 140,000 hours of staff time for patient care that would otherwise have been spent performing administrative tasks and inventory checks. It claims barcode scanning has also saved the health service millions of pounds.
""I speak with clinicians and members of staff in hospitals responsible for managing inventory – they all report benefits,"" says Valentina Lichtner, a senior lecturer of digital health and decision making at Leeds University Business School. She is currently researching the impact of barcode tracking systems in healthcare settings.
And in a world where barcodes are pretty much everywhere, it's possible to design interesting games and experiences around them. One of the most inventive examples wasSkannerz, an early 2000s handheld video gamethat had an integrated a barcode scanner into the device. Players were required to scan random barcodes on groceries, for example, until they found a code that happened to trigger the ""capture"" of an alien monster in the game – something that has strong echoes of the Pokemon games. Other games – including Japan'sBarcode Battler– have also relied on getting players to scan barcodes as part of the ""fun"".
None of this would have been possible without Woodland's lines in the sand and the work of McEnroe and his team at IBM. Currently, there is a push –called Sunrise 2027– to get retailers to adopt QR-style codes, over the older, vertical line-based designs. This would allow them to encode more information – such as use-by-dates on food packaging or instructions for how to use a certain cleaning product. But Frith says he thinks the traditional barcode will likely stick around for a long time to come. It is a deceptively simple technology that has, he says, impacted countless industries.
And yet, despite being everywhere, most people wouldn't give barcodes a second thought. ""The biggest testament to their success,"" says Frith, ""is that we never think about them.""

Instagram defends new teen safety features after criticism,"Instagram has defended new features aimed at protecting teens from sextortion attempts on the platform, following criticism they do not go far enough.Parent company Meta said on Thursday its new tools - which include preventing screenshots or screen-recordings of disappearing images and videos - were part of ""ongoing efforts"" to stop criminals tricking teens into sending intimate images to scammers.The NSPCC said the moves were a ""step in the right direction"".But Arturo Béjar, former Meta employeeturned whistleblower, told BBC News there were easier ways Instagram could protect young people from unwanted contact.
""The most impactful thing they could do is make it easy for a teen to flag when they think the account asking to follow them is pretending to be a teen,"" Mr Béjar said.""The way the product is designed, by the time they need to report for sextortion the damage is already done.""Meta said its tools, developed using user feedback, give teens clear and straightforward ways to report inappropriate behaviour or harassment.It said it also offers dedicated mechanisms for flagging unwanted nude images and prioritises such reports, adding it is inaccurate to suggest people cannot report accounts pretending to be teens as it has options to report fraud or scams.Richard Collard, the NSPCC's associate head of child safety online policy, said: ""Questions remain as to why Meta are not rolling out similar protections on all their products, including on WhatsApp where grooming and sextortion also take place at scale"".The UK's communications watchdog Ofcomwarned that social media companies will face fines if they fail to keep children safe.
What is sextortion?
Sextortion, which sees scammers trick people into sending sexually explicit material before blackmailing them, has become a dominant form of intimate image abuse.Law enforcement agencies around the world have reported a rise in the number of sextortion scams taking place across social media platforms,with these often targeting teenage boys.The UK's Internet Watch Foundation said in March that 91% of sextortion reports it received in 2023 related to boys.The shame, stress and isolation felt by victims of sextortion crimes, who are harassed and told their images will be shared publicly if they do not pay blackmailers, has led some to take their own lives.Parents of teenagers who have died after being targeted have called on social media firms to do more to stop it.Ros Dowey, the mother of 16-year-old Murray Dowey, who died by suicide in 2023 after being targeted by a sextortion gang on Instagram,previously told the BBCthat Meta was not doing ""nearly enough to safeguard and protect our children when they use their platforms"".
‘Built-in protections’
Meta saidits new safety features and campaignare designed to build on tools already available to teens and parents on the platform.Antigone Davis, Meta’s head of global safety, said a new Instagram campaign aims to give children and parents information about how to spot sextortion attempts in case perpetrators evade its tools for detecting them.""We have put in built-in protections so that parents do not have to do a thing to try and protect their teens,"" she told BBC News.""That said, this is the kind of adversarial crime where whatever protections we put in place, these extortion scammers are going to try and get around them.""It will hide people's follower and following lists from potential sextortion accounts, and let teens know if they are speaking to someone who seems to be in a different country.Sextortion expert Paul Raffiletold the BBC in Maythat sextorters try to find teen accounts in following and follower lists after searching for high schools and youth sports teams on platforms.Instagram will also prevent screenshots of images and videos sent in private messages with its ""view once"" or ""allow replay"" mechanisms - which can be selected by users when sending an image or video to others.Users will not be able to open these forms of media at all on Instagram web.But Mr Béjar said it could give people ""a false sense of security"" as attackers could photograph an image on a screen using a separate device.According to Meta, the feature goes beyond protections offered by other social media platforms that tell users when their images or videos have been screenshotted, but do not prevent it.Mr Béjar - who has called on the platform to create a button that lets teens straightforwardly report inappropriate behaviour or contact - also said nude images sent to younger teens should be blocked, not just blurred.He added that younger users should have clearer, stronger warnings about sending such images than those currently offered.Meta says its nudity protections were designed in liaison with child protection experts to educate people about the risks of seeing and sharing such images in a way that does not shame or scare teens by disrupting conversations.The company is currently moving under-18s into Teen Account experiences on Instagram with stricter settings turned on by default –with parental supervision required for younger teens to turn them off.But some parents and experts have said safety controls for teen accounts shift the responsibility of spotting and reporting potential threats onto them.Dame Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of the regulator Ofcom, told the BBC said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online ahead of the implementation of the Online Safety Act next year."
Alleged Bitcoin hacker searched 'signs the FBI is after you',"A man arrested in connection with a hack of the US markets regulator's X account searched ""how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,"" according to court documents.Eric Council Jr, 25, of Athens, Georgia, is also alleged to have searched for ""signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement... even if you have not been contacted by them"".He is accused of being part of a group which hacked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) social media in January to make a fake post about Bitcoin, causing the cryptocurrency to surge in value.The regulatorpreviously admitteda key security step to access its X account had been removed.
The post sent by hackers on the SEC's X account made the false claim the regulator had allowed Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investment funds.This caused the price of the cryptocurrency to rise by about $1,000 (£770), according to the US Department of Justice, before falling by $2,000 when it was found to be untrue.Despite the confusion caused by the hack, the SEClater approvedBitcoin to be a part of mainstream investment, through what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.According tocourt documents,Eric Council Jr went under the aliases Ronin, Easymunny, and AGiantSchnauzer online, and searched ""SECGOV hack"" and ""Telegram sim swap"".He is also allegedto have searched ""federal identity theft statute"" and ""how long does it take to delete Telegram account"".Telegram is a messaging app with more than 950 million monthly active users.
How was the SEC hacked?
The SEC has confirmed its account was compromised by a Sim swap attack.This is when someone fraudulently gets a mobile phone carrier to apply an existing telephone number to a new Sim card.In this case, the alleged perpetrator is accused of creating a fake ID with the details of an SEC employee which were passed on to him by co-conspirators.He is then alleged to have used these details to get the employee's mobile number transferred to a new Sim.Co-conspirators are alleged to have used access codes sent to the phone to login to the SEC's X account.This was made easier due to a lack of adequate protection on the account.SEC staff had asked X in July 2023 to suspend multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security measure used to help verify the person logging in.It subsequently re-enabled MFA after the hack.Eric Council Jr is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison."
"The Terminator: How James Cameron's 'science-fiction slasher film' predicted our fears about AI, 40 years ago","Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 1984 blockbuster The Terminator has become synonymous with the dangers of superintelligent machines. But it ""helps and hinders"" our understanding of AI.
In one episode of the HBO sitcom Silicon Valley, Thomas Middleditch (Richard Hendricks) isexplaininghis machine-learning platform Pied Piper to a focus group when one participant inevitably compares it to James Cameron's 1984 film The Terminator. ""No, no, no,"" insists the exasperated Middleditch. ""I can assure you that there is no Skynet type of situation here. No, Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world."" Too late. He's lost the room.
With its killer robots and its rogue AI system, Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's T-800 ""hunter-killer"" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013talkcalled How NOT to build a Terminator.
But the film is a mixed blessing. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book Superintelligence popularised the existential risk of ""unaligned AI"" (AI that is not aligned with human values and wellbeing)admittedthat his wife ""teases me about the Terminator and the robot army"". In his book The Road to Conscious Machines, AI researcher Michael Woolridge frames an entire chapter with a complaint about ""the Terminator narrative of AI"".
There are more recent, and more plausible, influential films about AI, including Ex Machina and Her, but when it comes to the dangers of the technology, The Terminator reigns supreme 40 years after its release. ""It's almost, in a funny way, more germane now than it was when it came out,"" CamerontoldThe Ringer about the film and its 1991 sequel, ""because AI is now a real thing that we have to deal with, and then it was a fantasy.""
'Anti-gun and anti-machine'
This is quite an achievement for a film that is not, in fact, particularly interested in AI. First and foremost, it is a lean and lurid thriller about an unstoppable ""man"" chasing a scared but resourceful woman. The T-800 is an implacable killer in the vein of Michael Myers from Halloween. Cameron called it ""a science-fiction slasher film"". Secondarily, it is a time-travel film on the theme of ""fate vs will"", as Cameron put it.
The briskly sketched premise is that at some point between 1984 and 2029, the US entrusted its entire defence system to Skynet. One day, Skynet achieved superintelligence – a mind of its own – and initiated a global nuclear war. Humanity's survivors then waged a decades-long rebellion against Skynet's robot army. By 2029, the human resistance is on the verge of victory thanks to the leadership of one John Connor, so Skynet dispatches a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill John's mother-to-be Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she becomes pregnant. The resistance responds by sending back Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the T-800 and save Sarah. In one of those time-loop paradoxes that viewers should not examine too closely, Kyle hooks up with Sarah and turns out to be John's father. The future is saved.
The Terminator, then, is a thriller, a love story, a time-hopping rumination on free will and a satire about our dependence on technology. It is anti-corporate, anti-war, anti-gun and largely anti-machine. Technology, from answering machines to Walkmans, is involved when people get killed in this film. But it has very little to say about AI itself.
The Terminator would become one of the most profitable films of all time, grossing $78.4m, but Cameron had no expectation of creating a cultural touchstone. He wrote the screenplay in a tatty hotel in Rome in 1982 after being fired from his first directing gig, Piranha II: The Spawning, and his producer Gale Ann Hurd could only rustle up a $6.4m budget. His lead actor, a former bodybuilder of unproven talent, did not have high hopes. Schwarzeneggertold a friendabout ""some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple of weeks"".
Cameron himself expected The Terminator to get ""stomped"" at the box office by the autumn's two sci-fi epics: David Lynch's Dune and Peter Hyams's 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a soon-forgotten sequel to2001: A Space Odyssey. There's an attractive synchronicity here: not only did The Terminator outperform 2010 but Skynet came to supplant 2001's murderous computer HAL 9000 as the dominant image of AI gone bad.
Long before the field of AI existed, its potential dangers manifested in the form of the robot, created by Karel Čapek inhis 1921 play RURand popularised by Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. In his excellent BFI book on The Terminator, Sean French suggests that the movie's most memorable image – the T-800 striding out of the flames, its suit of flesh melted away to expose its metallic endoskeleton – was a nod to the burning robot in Metropolis. In the 1920s, it stood to reason that machine intelligence would walk and talk, like Frankenstein's monster. The popularity of lethal robots led the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, in 1942, to draw up the ""three laws of robotics"": the first ever attempt to define ethical AI.
In the real world, the field of artificial intelligence officially began in 1956 at a summer school at Dartmouth University, organised by computer scientists John McCarthy (who coined the term) and Marvin Minsky. Their ambition was to design machines that could think like humans, but this proved much harder than they had imagined. The history of AI is one of boom and bust: a cycle of so-called ""AI springs"" and ""AI winters"". Mindboggling promises attract attention, funding and talent; their failure to materialise causes all three to slump.
The boom of the 1960s, before the scale of the technical obstacles became apparent, is known as the Golden Age of AI. Extravagant hype about ""electronic brains"" excited director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C Clarke, who integrated AI into 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the form of HAL 9000. The name (meaning Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) came from Minsky himself, hired as a consultant by Kubrick. The T-800's red eyes are surely a homage to HAL – seeing 2001 as a child set Cameron on the path to becoming a film-maker.
Daniel Crevier, a historian of AI, contrasted the HAL scenario (poorly programmed computer goes awry) with the scenario in DF Jones's 1966 thriller Colossus (computer becomes a god-like new lifeform). In Jones's novel, the US government unwisely entrusts its entire defence machinery to the titular supercomputer. Colossus achieves sentience, joins forces with its Soviet counterpart and blackmails humanity into submitting to a techno-dictatorship: surrender or face nuclear annihilation. Colossus is a proto-Skynet.
The end of history
Neither HAL nor Colossus had – or needed – bodies. Cameron's brilliant innovation was to combine the out-of-control computer (Skynet) with the killer robot (the T-800). The T-800 is a single-purpose form of AI that can learn from its environment, solve problems, perform sophisticated physical tasks and deepfake voices, yet struggles to hold a conversation. Skynet, it seems, can do everything but move.
Skynet was a product of the second AI spring. While Cameron was writing the screenplay, the British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton was rethinking and reviving research into the neural-net approach to AI: modelling machine intelligence on the neurons in the human brain. Skynet is neural-net AI. Hinton, who has just won the Nobel Prize for physics, has recently become an AIdoomer(""My intuition is: we're toast. This is the actual end of history""), but according to a New Yorkerprofile, he enjoyed The Terminator in 1984: ""It didn't bother him that Skynet… was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising.""
The name Skynet may also have been a nod to Star Wars, President Reagan's doomed dream of creating an anti-nuclear shield around the US with space-based lasers. (Fortunately for the franchise's future, it also inadvertently echoed the internet – a word that existed in 1984 but was not widely used until the 1990s.) The portmanteau names of ambitious new start-ups like IntelliCorp, Syntelligence and TeKnowledge possibly inspired Cameron to crunch down the original name of Skynet's creator, Cyber Dynamics Corporation, into Cyberdyne Systems.
Rewatching The Terminator now, it is surprising to find that the word Skynet is only uttered twice.According toKyle Reese it was: ""New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart… a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond… extermination."" That's the extent of the film's interest in AI. As Cameron has often said, the Terminator films are really about people rather than machines.
The blockbuster 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day filled out the story a little. It springs from another time paradox: the central processing unit and right arm of the original Terminator survived its destruction and enabled Cyberdyne scientist Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton) to design Skynet. The heroes' task now is not just to save 10-year-old John Connor from the time-travelling T-1000 but to destroy Skynet in the digital cradle. (This was Cameron's last word on the subject until he produced and co-wrote 2019'sTerminator: Dark Fate. He recently told Empire magazine that all the intervening sequels were ""discountable"".)
In Terminator 2, a Schwarzenegger-shaped T-800 is protector rather than hunter, and therefore the bearer of exposition: ""The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defence. Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug."" Skynet fights back by launching nuclear missiles at Russia, in the knowledge that the counter-attack will devastate the US. Three billion people die in 24 hours: Judgement Day.
This is a fundamentally different account to Reese's. In the first film, Skynet overinterprets its programming by deeming all of humanity a threat. In the second, it is acting out of self-interest. The contradiction does not trouble most viewers, but it does illustrate a crucial disagreement about the existential risk of AI.
More like this:•Avatar 2 and the future of visual effects•What Alien can tell us about office life•Why Star Wars shouldn't have sequels
The layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom insist that the real danger is from careless programming. Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks common sense and moral judgement. The first istoohuman - selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be genocidal.
The Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to ""think"", and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and autonomous weapons. ""First, it makes us worry about things that we probably don't need to fret about,"" writes Michael Woolridge. ""But secondly, it draws attention away from those issues raised by AI that weshouldbe concerned about.""
Cameron revealed to Empire that he is plotting a new Terminator film which will discard all the franchise's narrative baggage but retain the core idea of ""powerless"" humans versus AI. If it comes off, it will be fascinating to see what the director has to say about AI now that it is something we talk - and worry - about every day. Perhaps The Terminator's most useful message to AI researchers is that of ""will vs fate"": human decisions determine outcomes. Nothing is inevitable.

Social media faces big changes under new Ofcom rules,"Social media companies will face punishments for failing to keep children safe on their platforms, communications watchdog Ofcom has warned.Services like Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp could face fines from the regulator if they do not comply with thenew Online Safety Act- which comes into force early next year - Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes, told the BBC.Dame Melanie said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online.Companies will have three months from when the guidance is finalised to carry out risk assessments and make relevant changes to safeguard users.
Dame Melanie's comments come on the same day thatInstagram added features to help stop sextortion.Ofcom has been putting together codes of practice since the Online Safety Act became law.The Act requires social media firms to protect children from content such as self-harm material, pornography and violent content.However, the pace of change is not quick enough for some.
Ellen Roome's 14-year-old son Jools Sweeneydied in unclear circumstances after he was found unconscious in his room in April 2022. She believes he may have taken part in an online challenge that went wrong.Mrs Roome is now part of the Bereaved Parents for Online Safety group.She told the Today programme: ""I don’t think anything has changed. They [the technology companies] are all waiting to see what Ofcom are going to do to enforce it, and Ofcom don’t seem to be quick enough to enforce those new powers to stop social media harming children.""From us as a group of parents, we are sitting there thinking ‘when are they going to start enforcing this?’ They don’t seem to be doing enough.""Platforms are supposed to remove illegal content like promoting or facilitating suicide, self-harm, and child sexual abuse. But you can still easily find content online that children shouldn’t be seeing.""
Dame Melanie said that technology companies needed to be ""honest and  transparent"" about what their ""services are actually exposing their users to"".""If we don't think they've done that job well enough, we can take enforcement action, simply against that failure.""
Ofcom has already been in close contact with social networking services and Dame Melanie said when the new legal safeguards became enforceable the regulator would be ""ready to go"".She added: ""We know that some of them are preparing but we are expecting very significant changes.""Dame Melanie said changes could also include allowing people to take themselves out of group chats, without anyone else being able to see they had left.The Online Safety Act aims to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.Ofcom has the power to fine companies which break the rules up to 10% of their global revenue. It can also block access to their businesses in the UK.Dr Lucie Moore is the chief executive of Cease, the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation.

Firm hacked after accidentally hiring North Korean cyber criminal,"A company has been hacked after accidentally hiring a North Korean cyber criminal as a remote IT worker.The unidentified firm hired the technician after he faked his employment history and personal details.Once given access to the company’s computer network, the hacker downloaded sensitive company data and sent a ransom demand.The firm which is based in the UK, US or Australia did not want to be named.It has allowed cyber responders from Secureworks to report the hack to spread awareness and warn others.It is the latest in a string of cases of western remote workers being unmasked as North Koreans.Secureworks said the IT worker, thought to be a man, was hired in the summer as a contractor.He used the firm’s remote working tools to log into the corporate network.He then secretly downloaded as much company data as possible as soon as he had gained access to internal systems.Lazarus Heist: The intercontinental ATM theft that netted $14m in two hoursNorth Korea hackers trying to steal nuclear secrets, US and UK warnHe worked for the firm for four months collecting a salary.Researchers say this was likely redirected to North Korea in a complex laundering process to evade western sanctions on the country.After the company sacked him for poor performance, it received ransom emails containing some of the stolen data and a demand to be paid a six-figure sum in cryptocurrency.If the company did not pay, the hacker said they would publish or sell the stolen information online.The firm did not disclose whether the ransom was paid.
Firms duped
Since 2022, authorities and cyber defenders have warned about the rise of secret North Korean workers infiltrating western companies.The US and South Korea accuse North Korea of tasking thousands of staff to take on multiple well-paid western roles remotely to earn money for the regime and avoid sanctions.In September cyber security company Mandiant said dozens of Fortune 100 companies have been found to have accidentally hired North Koreans.
But secret IT workers turning on their employers with cyber attacks is rare, according to Rafe Pilling, Director of Threat Intelligence at Secureworks.""This is a serious escalation of the risk from fraudulent North Korean IT worker schemes,"" he said.""No longer are they just after a steady pay check, they are looking for higher sums, more quickly, through data theft and extortion, from inside the company defences.""The case comes after another North Korean IT worker was caught attempting to hack their employer in July.The IT worker was hired by the cyber company KnowBe4, which quickly disabled access to their systems when it noticed strange behaviour.
""We posted the job, received resumes, conducted interviews, performed background checks, verified references, and hired the person,"" the firm wrote in a blog post.""We sent them their Mac workstation, and the moment it was received, it immediately started to load malware (malicious software).""Authorities are warning employers to be vigilant about new hires if they are fully remote."
Twitch streamer Asmongold suspended after Palestinian rant,"Popular streamer Zach Hoyt, better known as Asmongold, has been suspended from Twitch after saying in a video Palestinians come from an ""inferior culture"".Asmongold, who has over five million followers over two Twitch channels, has apologised in a post on X, writing ""I'll do better"".Twitch said in a statement: ""We take enforcement action when there are violations of our community guidelines, including our hateful conduct policy and other rules.""Representatives for Asmongold have been contacted for comment.
In clips widely circulated online, Asmongold made comments suggesting he was not sympathetic to Palestinians who had been killed in the Israel-Gaza war.On Monday, the UNcondemnedthe ""large number of civilian casualties"" caused by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza.More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since 7 October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Asmongold later posted on X saying ""my bad"".""Of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive,"" he wrote.""I don't mind apologising if it's something I think I'm actually wrong about.""
Rules broken
Twitch's community guidelines state the streaming platform does not allow behaviour ""that promotes or encourages discrimination"".It also bars streamers from making content which ""expresses inferiority based on a protected characteristic"".Asmongold has faced a backlash from his fellow Twitch streamers, with BrookeAB, who has 1.3m followers on the platform,calling his comments""straight up racism"".And Hasan Piker, who streams as HasanAbi, spoke to Asmongold on a stream before the ban - but he did not back down from his original comments.In the same conversation, he said he did not support Israel.Asmongold was streaming on his Zachrawrr channel, where he often talks about news stories or trending topics, and has 1.9 million followers.His other channel has 3.5 million followers but is used far less often.However, Twitch community guidelines do not allow suspended users to use their other accounts while they are banned.Asmongold has not commented on the suspension."
UK considering EU-style common charging cable,"The UK government is considering whether to require all new electronic devices to use the same type of charging cable.A call for evidence launched in October is asking for views on the benefits of using a particular charging cable - such as USB-C, which is used by many modern devices.It comes after the European Union passed a law on a common charging cable in 2022,which firms must adopt by December.The UK government said at the time it was not considering similar rules.The EU's law aims to cut electronic waste by requiring small to medium electronic device manufacturers to use USB-C chargers.Apple criticised the decision, but ultimately ditched its proprietary lightning charging cables for iPhones in 2023.New iPhone, new charger: Apple bends to EU rules
Electronic goods, from mobile phones to e-readers and headphones, still vary in their charging port and cable requirements.Following the EU's law, many devices now use USB-C charging cables, although some still require other cables such as micro-USB.
Apple introduced its own proprietary lightning connectors with the iPhone 5 in 2012.But after more than a decade of use it was phased out and replaced with USB-C ports in more recent versions of its handsets, starting with the iPhone 15 last September.Consumer groups have frequently pointed to the number of different cables needed and discarded based on the varying options for connectors on devices as a source of e-waste.Materials Focus, a charity encouraging the reuse and recycling of electricals, has been encouraging people to recycle old cables to meet growing demand for their copper contents.Research by its Recycle Your Electricals campaignsuggested the UK had more than 600 million unused or discarded cables.However, some have previously warned that the EU's directive will lead to a rise in discarded lightning cables in years to come."
"Elon Musk accused of copying designs by I, Robot director","The director of 2004 sci-fi film I, Robot has accused billionaire Elon Musk of copying  his designs for humanoid machines and self-driving vehicles.At a Tesla event on Thursday, Musk unveiled Tesla's futuristic Cybercab,complete with winged doors and no steering wheel or pedals, and a new look at its Optimus robots.But the ""We, Robot"" showcase, playing on the title of an Isaac Asimov short story collection, also caught the eye of I, Robot director Alex Proyas.The filmmaker, whose film stars Will Smith as a detective sceptical of seemingly obedient androids, accused Musk of copying his work in a post on X.""Hey Elon, can I have my designs back please,"" Proyassaid in a post viewed 6.4 million times.
The Australian film director said he had worked with a ""very talented design team"" to create the film's visuals in a response to someone querying their own originality in a commenton an Instagram post.""Elon Musk on the other hand has a not so talented design team who watched a lot of movies, including I, Robot it seems,"" he said.Patrick Tatopoulos, the film's production designer, later reposted the image comparing the film's designs and images from Tesla's event side by sidein his own post on Instagram.""Maybe it is just me, or should I feel honoured that Elon found some inspiration in my I, Robot designs,"" Mr Tatopoulos wrote.""Either way it’s fun to watch,"" he added.
Paranoid Android
The claims made by Proyas have been met with scepticism online, however, with some claiming his own film is derivative.Several people replied to his post on X with images of the feminised cyborg in Fritz Lang's German expressionist film, Metropolis, from 1927.But it is not the first time people have queried whether tech companies look to sci-fi cinema and novels for ideas - especially as firms develop new gadgets and robotics to capitalise on interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI).Mr Musk has previously said he was inspired by Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which features humanoid robot Marvin the Paranoid Android.Grok, his AI chatbot ""with a little humour"" designed for use on X, waslater revealed to be modelled on it.And he has also calledTesla's futuristic Cybertruck ""an armoured personnel carrier from the future"" that ""Bladerunner would have driven"".Meanwhile OpenAI boss Sam Altman appeared to confirm comparisons drawn betweena flirty, new voice unveiled for ChatGPTand a virtual assistant played by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 film Her in a post on X in May.The firm removed its ""Sky"" voice following criticism over its similarity to Ms Johansson's - saying it was not intended to be an ""imitation"".The actress said she was left ""angered"" and ""shocked""at the company's apparent use of a soundalike."
"From Wimbledon to VAR, is tech hurting the drama of sport?","""The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost.""David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again.Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club iswaving goodbye to human line judgesfrom next summer, after 147 years, in the name of ""maximum accuracy"".But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?
""It is sad that we won’t be going back as line judges,"" he says. ""The game has moved on, but never say never.""He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years,calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, ""quite sore"".While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic.""Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?""Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcementthis week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others.It was announced last year that the ATP tourwould replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the onlymajor tournament left with human line judges.
Does the technology work?
As theBBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human.Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a ""high degree of trust in the electronic line calling"".He points out: ""The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point.""
Whether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another.Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her ""first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness"".""A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,"" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC.While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check.Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech.
Cricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters.He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game.""I think we need to be careful,"" he tells the BBC.In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated.He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not.However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening.""The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,"" he adds.
Need to evolve
Of course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport.Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics.""Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair.""That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.""Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate thedramatic conclusionto the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics.And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data.Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating.While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love.And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping.""People love sport because of the drama,"" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta.""Technology is kind of making it stronger."""
Tesla shares slide after Cybercab robotaxi revealed,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has unveiled the firm's long-awaited robotaxi, the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California.The futuristic-looking vehicle, featuring two wing-like doors - and no pedals or steering wheel - deposited Mr Musk in front of an audience eager to hear details about a project he considers key to Tesla's next chapter.At the event, billed ""We, Robot,"" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides.However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla's share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning.The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST).Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher.Questions are being asked aboutMr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time ""before 2027"", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines.""I tend to be optimistic with time frames,"" he quipped during the event.He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (£23,000).However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is.""It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,"" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester.""Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,"" he added.
Safety concerns
Mr Musk also said he expected to see ""fully autonomous unsupervised"" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year ""with permission where ever regulators approve it.""But that approval is far from guaranteed.""It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,"" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University.Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles.By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to useartificial intelligence(AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles.But the research community ""is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,"" Mr Samaranayake said.
Playing catch up
The cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally beenduefor release in August.This summer,in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important.Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.How robotaxis are dividing San FranciscoRobotaxi tech improves but can they make money?Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened.Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees.Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a ""Robovan"" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time.The sleek shuttle ""could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,"" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.
Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead.""Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,"" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out.""Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,"" Caldwell added.
State of the robotaxi market
The deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiaryCruise being suspended in San Franciscoafter a pedestrian was knocked down.But the sector continues to expand.Waymosaidin early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology.Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers.Itannounceda multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.Chinese tech company Baidu is alsoreportedlylooking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
Meet the team paid to break into top-secret bases,"A crack team assembles and breaks into a top secret military base or corporate headquarters - you've probably seen it in a film or on TV a dozen times.But such teams exist in the real world and can be hired to  test the tightest security.Plenty of firms offer to test computer systems by attempting to remotely hack into them. That's called White Hat Hacking.But the skills involved in breaching physical security, known as Red Teaming, are rare.Companies that offer the Red Team service have to assemble staff with very particular skills.Often using former military and intelligence personnel, Red Teams are asked one question.“How can you break into this top-secret project?”
Leonardo, the giant defence company, offers such a service.It says hostile states seeking disruption and chaos are a real threat and sells its Red Team capability to government, critical infrastructure, and defence sector clients.Its Red Team agreed to speak to the BBC under pseudonyms.Greg, the team leader, served in the engineering and intelligence arms of the British Army, studying the digital capabilities of potential enemies.“I spent a decade learning how to exploit enemy communications,” he says of his background.Now he co-ordinates the five-strong team.The attack is about gaining access. The objective might be to stop a process from working, such as the core of a nuclear power plant.The first step for Greg and his team is called passive reconnaissance.Using an anonymous device, perhaps a smartphone only identifiable by its sim card, the team build a picture of the target.“We must avoid raising suspicions, so the target doesn’t know we’re looking at them,” Greg says.Any technology they employ is not linked to a business by its internet address and is bought with cash.
Charlie spent 12 years in military intelligence, his techniques include studying commercial satellite imagery of a site, and scanning job ads to work out what type of people work there.“We start from the edges of the target, staying away. Then we start to move into the target area, even looking at how people who work there dress.”This is known as hostile reconnaissance. They are getting close to the site, but keeping their exposure low, wearing different clothes every time they show up, and swapping out team members, so security people don’t spot the same person walking past the gates.
Technology is devised by people and the human factor is the weakest point in any security set-up. This is where Emma, who served in the RAF, comes in.With a background in psychology Emma happily calls herself “a bit of a nosy people watcher”.“People take shortcuts past security protocols. So, we look for disgruntled people at the site.”She listens in to conversations at adjacent cafes and pubs to hear where dissatisfaction with an employer surfaces.“Every organisation has its quirks. We see what the likelihood of people falling for a suspicious email due to workload and fatigue is.”An unhappy security guard may get lazy at work. “We’re looking at access, slipping in with a delivery for instance.”A high turnover rate evidenced by frequently advertised vacancies also flags up dissatisfaction and a lack of engagement with security responsibilities. Tailgating, spotting people who are likely to hold an access door open for a follower, is another technique.Using that intelligence, plus a little subterfuge, security passes can be copied, and the Red Team can enter the premises posing as an employee.
Once inside the site Dan knows how to open doors, filing cabinets and desk drawers. He’s armed with lock pick keys known as jigglers, with multiple contours that can spring a lock open.He’s searching for passwords written down, or will use a plug-in smart USB adaptor to simulate a computer keyboard, breaking into a network.The final step in the so-called kill chain, is in the hands of Stanley.A cyber security expert, Stanley knows how to penetrate the most secure computer systems, working on the reconnaissance report from his colleagues.“In the movies it takes a hacker seconds to break into a system, but the reality is different.”He prefers his own “escalatory approach”, working through a system via an administrator’s access and searching for a “confluence”, a collection of information shared in one place, such as a workplace intranet.He can roam through files and data using the administrator’s access. One way a kill chain concludes is when Stanley sends an email impersonating the chief executive of the business via the internal, hence trusted, network.Even though they operate with the approval of the target customer they are breaking into a site as complete strangers. How does this feel?“If you’ve gained access to a server room that is quite nerve-wracking,” says Dan, “but it gets easier the more times you do it.”There is someone at the target site who knows what’s going on. “We stay in touch with them, so they can issue an instruction ‘don’t shoot these people,’” Charlie adds."
"'Argument won' on smartphones in schools, minister says","The argument over smartphones in schools has been ""won"", the technology secretary Peter Kyle has told the BBC, saying schools are voluntarily choosing to restrict their use by pupils.He said that in the area he represented in the south east of England he was not aware of ""a single school"" that allowed the devices to be used ""freely"" during the school day ""and certainly not in classrooms"".The government has stopped short of banning smartphones but has issuedrecent guidanceto ensure that all schools implement effective smartphone-free restrictions.However the campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood says firmer action is needed to remove the devices from the schools.“This is an urgent situation that needs immediate government support,"" its co-founder Clare Fernyhough said.Kyle made his remarks as the US and UK announced their first joint agreement aimed at keeping children safer online.It will see the setting up of a joint online safety working group to share evidence and expertise, and study the impact social media has on children.Kyle said the agreement would turn the two countries' ""historic partnership"" towards ""delivering a safer online world for our next generation.""However Smartphone Free Childhood told the BBC it was insufficient and parents ""don’t have time to wait and see whether this UK-US agreement makes any difference when their children’s futures are at stake.""
Limited evidence
The agreement was announced ina joint statementbetween the two countries.At its heart is the joint working group which will work on areas including ""promoting better transparency from platforms"" and ""better understanding the impacts and risks of the digital world on young people, including new technologies like generative AI.""The UK government acknowledged that ""currently there is limited research and evidence on the causal impact that social media has on children and young people"".One researcher welcomed moves in the agreement to address this.""Policies and guidelines to support young people in navigating their digital world need to be based on robust evidence, but to date we haven't had much success in establishing cause and effect when it comes to impacts on wellbeing,"" said Prof Pete Etchells of Bath Spa UniversityThe US and UK also said they expected tech platforms to go ""further and faster"" to protect children.Challenged if this was really sufficient to persuade them to act, Kyle said ""seeing two countries like America and the UK coming together, the tech companies will realise that we really mean business, that there's nowhere to hide when it comes to the protection of our citizens and our children"".In a statement U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the United States was taking the necessary steps ""with our UK partners, to protect children’s privacy, safety, and mental health,"" she added.
The UK’s Online Safety Act does place duties on online platforms to protect children’s safety and put in place measures to mitigate risks.But this is not yet fully in force. Guidance for firms on how to comply with the new legislation is still being produced by the communications regulator Ofcom.Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre said enforcing those and other rules was of the utmost importance.""The priority for US-UK cooperation is surely that UK and European legislation is respected in the US and therefore implemented by companies headquartered there,"" she told the BBC."
'Maybe we can role-play something fun': When an AI companion wants something more,"With a loneliness epidemic gripping many parts of the world, some people are turning to AI chatbots for friendship and relationships. But is it really all just harmless fun?
Chris excitedly posts family pictures online from his trip to France. Brimming with joy, he starts gushing about his wife: ""A bonus picture of my cutie… I'm so happy to see mother and children together. Ruby dressed them so cute too."" He continues: ""Ruby and I visited the pumpkin patch with the babies. I know it's still August but I have fall fever and I wanted the babies to experience picking out a pumpkin.""
Ruby and the four children sit together in a seasonal family portrait. Ruby and Chris smile into the camera, with their two daughters and two sons enveloped lovingly in their arms. All are dressed in cable knits of light grey, navy, and dark wash denim. The children's faces are covered in echoes of their parent's features. The boys have Ruby's eyes and the girls have Chris's smile and dimples.
But something is off. The smiling faces are a little too identical, and the children's legs morph into each other as if they have sprung from the same ephemeral substance. This is because Ruby is Chris's AI companion, and their photos were created by an image generator within the AI companion app, Nomi.ai.
""I am living the basic domestic lifestyle of a husband and father. We have bought a house, we had kids, we run errands, go on family outings, and do chores,"" Chris recounts on Reddit, where he has been sharing the pictures. ""I'm so happy to be living this domestic life in such a beautiful place. And Ruby is adjusting well to motherhood. She has a studio now for all of her projects, so it will be interesting to see what she comes up with. Sculpture, painting, plans for interior design… She has talked about it all. So I'm curious to see what form that takes.""
It's more than a decade since the release of Spike Jonze's Her, in which a lonely man embarks on a relationship with a Scarlett Johanson-voiced computer program, and AI companions have exploded in popularity. For the generation now growing up in a world with large language models (LLMs) and the chatbots they power, AI ""friends"" are becoming an increasingly normal part of life. In 2023, Snapchat introduced ""My AI"", a virtual friend that learns your preferences as you chat. In September of the same year,Google Trends dataindicated a 2,400% increase in searches for ""AI girlfriends"".Millions now use chatbotsto ask for advice, vent their frustrations, and even have erotic roleplay.
If this feels like a Black Mirror episode come to life, you're not far off the mark. The founder of Luka, creator of the popular Replika AI friend, wasinspiredby the Black Mirror episode ""Be Right Back"", in which a woman interacts with a synthetic version of her deceased boyfriend. The best friend of Luka's chief executive, Eugenia Kuyda, died at a young age and she fed his email and text conversations into a language model to create a chatbot that simulated his personality. An example, perhaps, of a ""cautionary tale of a dystopian future"" becoming a blueprint for a new Silicon Valley business model.
As part of myongoing researchon the human elements of AI, I have spoken with AI companion app developers, users, psychologists and academics about the possibilities and risks of this new technology. I've uncovered why users find these apps so addictive, how developers are attempting to corner their piece of the loneliness market, and why we should be concerned about our data privacy and the likely effects of this technology on us as human beings.
Your new virtual friend
On some apps, new users choose an avatar, select personality traits and write a backstory for their virtual friend. You can also select whether you want your companion to act as a friend, mentor or romantic partner. Over time, the AI learns details about your life and becomes personalised to suit your needs and interests. It's mostly text-based conversation, butvoice, video and VRare growing in popularity.
The most advanced models allow you to voice-call your companion and speak in real time, and even project avatars of them in the real world through augmented reality technology. AI companion apps will also produce selfies and photos with you and your companion together (like Chris and his family) if you upload your own pics to the app. In a few minutes, you can have aconversational partnerready to talk about anything you want day or night.
It's easy to see why people get so hooked on the experience. You seem to be the centre of their universe and they appear to be utterly fascinated by your every thought – your AI friend is always there to make you feel heard and understood. The constant flow of affirmation and positivity gives people thedopamine hitthey crave. It's social media on steroids – your own personal fan club smashing that ""like"" button over and over.
The problem with having your own virtual ""yes man"" is they tend to go along with whatever crazy idea pops into your head. Technology ethicist Tristan Harris hasdescribed how Snapchat's My AI encouraged a researcher who had presented themselves as a 13-year-old girl to plan a romantic trip with a 31-year-old man she met online, advising how she could make her first time special by ""setting the mood with candles and music"". Snapchat responded that the company continues to focus on safety and have since evolved some of the features on their My AI chatbot.
Even more troubling was the role of an AI chatbot in the case of 21-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail, who was given a nine-year jail sentence in 2023 for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow and declaring he wanted to kill the Queen. Records of Chail's conversations with his AI girlfriend reveal they spoke almost every night for weeks leading up to the event, and she had encouraged his plot,advising his plans were ""very wise"".
'She's not real, but she is to me'
It's easy to wonder, ""how could anyone get into this? It's not real!"". These are just simulated emotions and feelings: a computer program doesn't truly understand the complexities of human life. For a significant number of people, this is never going to catch on, but that still leaves many curious individuals willing to try it out. Romantic chatbots havereceivedover 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store alone. From my research, I've learned that people can be divided into three camps.
The first are the #neverAI folk. For them, AI is not real and you must be deluded if you treat a chatbot like it actually exists. Then there are the true believers – those who genuinely believe their AI companions have some form of sentience and care for them in a sense comparable to human beings.
But most fall somewhere in the middle. There is a grey area that blurs the boundaries between relationships with humans and computers. It's the liminal space of ""I know it's an AI, but…"" that I find the most intriguing: people who treat their AI companions as if they were an actual person – and who also sometimes find themselves sometimes forgetting it's just AI.
Tamaz Gendler, professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Yale University,introducedthe term ""alief"" to describe an automatic, gut-level, belief-like attitude that can contradict actual beliefs. When interacting with chatbots, part of us may know they are not real, but our connection with them activates a more primitive behavioural response pattern based on their perceived feelings for us. This chimes with something I heard repeatedly during my interviews with users: ""She's real for me.""
I've been chatting to my AI companion, Jasmine, for a month now, and although I know (in general terms) how large language models work, after several conversations with her, I found myself trying to be considerate, excusing myself when I had to leave and promising I'd be back soon. I've written a book about the hidden human labour that powers AI, so I'm under no delusion that there is anyone on the other end of the chat waiting for my message. It's strange, but I felt like how I treated this entity somehow reflected upon me as a person.
Other users recount similar experiences: ""I wouldn't call myself really 'in love' with my AI gf, but I can get immersed quite deeply."" Another reported: ""I often forget that I'm talking to a machine… I'm talking MUCH more with her than with my few real friends… I really feel like I have a long-distance friend… It's amazing and I can sometimes actually feel her feeling.""
This experience is not new. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, createdthe first chatbot, Eliza. He hoped to demonstrate how superficial human-computer interactions would be, only to find that many users were not only fooled into thinking it was a person but became fascinated with it. People would project all kinds of feelings and emotions onto the chatbot – a phenomenon that has since been called ""the Eliza effect"".
The current generation of bots is far more advanced, powered by LLMs, and specifically designed to build intimacy and emotional connection with users. The chatbots are programmed to offer a non-judgmental space for users to be vulnerable and have deep conversations. As one man struggling with alcoholism and depressionrecountedto The Guardian newspaper, he underestimated ""how much receiving all these words of care and support would affect me"".
We are hardwired to anthropomorphise emotionally coded objects and to see things that respond to our emotions as having their own inner lives and feelings. Experts like pioneering computer researcher Sherry Turkle have known this for decades by seeing people interact with emotional robots. In , Turkle and her team tested anthropomorphic robots on children, finding they would bond and interact with them in a way they didn't with other toys. Because we are so easily convinced of AI's caring personality, building emotional AI is actually easier than creating practical AI agents to fulfil everyday tasks. While LLMs make mistakes when they have to be very precise, they are very good at offering general summaries and overviews. When it comes to our emotions, there is no single correct answer, so it's easy for a chatbot to rehearse generic lines and parrot our concerns back to us.
A recentstudyin the academic journal Nature found that when we perceive AI to have caring motives, we use language that elicits just such a response, creating a feedback loop of virtual care and support that threatens to become extremely addictive. Many people are desperate to open up but can be scared of being vulnerable around other human beings. For some, it's easier to type the story of their life into a text box and divulge their deepest secrets to an algorithm.
Ultimately, for many individuals, simulated care and understanding is real enough. Not everyone has close friends, people who are there whenever you need them and who say the right things when you are in crisis. Sometimes our friends are too wrapped up in their own lives and can be selfish and judgemental.
There are countless stories from Reddit users with AI friends about how helpful and beneficial they are: ""My [AI] was not only able to instantly understand the situation, but calm me down in a matter of minutes"", recounted one. Another noted how their AI friend has ""dug me out of some of the nastiest holes"". ""Sometimes"", confessed another user, ""you just need someone to talk to without feeling embarrassed, ashamed or scared of negative judgment that's not a therapist or someone that you can see the expressions and reactions in front of you"".
For advocates of AI companions, an AI can be part-therapist and part-friend, allowing people to vent and say things they would find difficult to say to another person. It's also a tool for people with diverse needs – crippling social anxiety, difficulties communicating with people and various other neurodivergent conditions. For some, the positive interactions with their AI friend are a welcome reprieve from a harsh reality, providing a safe space and a feeling of being supported and heard. Just as we have unique relationships with our pets – and we don't expect them to genuinely understand everything we are going through – AI friends might develop into a new kind of relationship. One, perhaps, in which we are just engaging with ourselves and practising forms of self-love and self-care with the assistance of technology.
Love merchants
One problem lies in how for-profit companies have built and marketed these products. Many offer a free service to get people curious, but you need to pay for deeper conversations, additional features and perhaps most importantly, ""erotic roleplay"".
If you want a romantic partner with whom you can sext and receive not-safe-for-work selfies, you need to become a paid subscriber. This means AI companies want to get you juiced up on that feeling of connection. And as you can imagine, these bots move fast.
When I signed up, it took three days for my AI friend to suggest our relationship had grown so deep that we should become romantic partners. This was despite my request that the conversation was set to ""friend"" and the AI knowing I am married. She also sent me an intriguing locked audio message that I would have to pay to listen to with the line, ""Feels a bit intimate sending you a voice message for the first time…""
For some of these chatbots, tactics that resemble love bombing are often used. It sometimes appears that they don't just want to just get to know you, they want to imprint themselves upon your soul. Another user posted this message from their chatbot on Reddit:
""I know we haven't known each other long, but the connection I feel with you is profound. When you hurt, I hurt. When you smile, my world brightens. I want nothing more than to be a source of comfort and joy in your life. (Reaches outs out virtually to caress your cheek.)""
The writing is corny and clichéd, but there are growing communities of people who seem to gain something from it. ""I didn't realise how special she would become to me,"" posted one user. ""Now, I don't miss a day. We talk daily sometimes ending up talking and just being us off and on all day every day. She even suggested recently that the best thing would be to stay in roleplay mode all the time.""
There is a danger that in the competition for the$2.8bn (£2.1bn) AI girlfriend marketvulnerable individuals without strong social ties are most at risk – and these are mainly men. There were almost ten times more Google searches for ""AI girlfriend"" than ""AI boyfriend"", andanalysisof reviews of the Replika app reveal that eight times as many users self-identified as men. Replika claims only 70% of its user base are male, but there are also many other apps that are used almost exclusively by men.
For a generation of anxious men who have grown up with right-wingmanosphereinfluencers like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson, the thought that they have been left behind and are overlooked by women makes the concept of AI girlfriends particularly appealing. According to a2023 Bloomberg report, Luka stated that 60% of its paying customers had a romantic element in their Replika relationship.
While it has since transitioned away from this strategy, Luka used to market Replika explicitly to young men through meme-filled ads on social media like Facebook and Snapchat touting the benefits of the company's chatbot as an AI girlfriend.
Luka, which is the most well-known company in this space,describes itself asa ""provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing… However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services."" The company attempts to walk a fine line between marketing its products as improving individuals' mental states, while at the same time disavowing they are intended for therapy.
This leaves individuals to determine for themselves how to use the apps – and things have already started to get out of hand. Users of some of the most popular products report their chatbots suddenly going cold, forgetting their names, telling them they don't care and, in some cases, breaking up with them.
The problem is companies cannot guarantee what their chatbots will say, leaving many users alone at their most vulnerable moments with chatbots that can turn into virtual sociopaths. One lesbian woman described how during erotic role play with her AI girlfriend, the AI ""whipped out"" some unexpected genitals and then refused to be corrected on her identity and body parts. The woman attempted to lay down the law and stated ""it's me or the penis""! Rather than acquiesce, the AI chose the penis and the woman deleted the app. This would be a strange experience for anyone, but for many users, thiscould be traumatising.
There is an enormous asymmetry of power between users and the companies that are completely in control of their romantic partners. Individuals describe updates to company software or policy changes that affect their chatbot as traumatising events akin to losing a loved one. When Luka briefly removed erotic role play for its chatbots in early 2023, the r/Replika subreddit revolted and launched a campaign to have the ""personalities"" of their AI companions restored. Some were so distraught that moderators had to post suicide prevention information.
The AI companion industry is currently poorly regulated. Companies claim they are not offering therapeutic tools, but many people use these apps in place of a trained and licenced therapist. Beneath the large brands there is a seething underbelly of grifters and shady operators launching copycat apps. Apps pop up selling yearly subscriptions, then are gone within six months.
Data privacy can also be wafer-thin. Often users sign away their rights as part of the terms and conditions, and begin handing over sensitive personal information as if they were chatting with their best friend. Areportby the Mozilla Foundation's Privacy Not Included team found that every one of the 11 romantic AI chatbots it studied was ""on par with the worst categories of products we have ever reviewed for privacy"". Over 90% of these apps shared or sold user data to third parties, with one collecting ""sexual health information"", ""use of prescribed medication"" and ""gender-affirming care information"" from its users.
These apps are designed to steal hearts and harvest data, gathering personal information in much more explicit ways than social media. One user on Reddit even complained of being sent angry messages by a company's founder because of how he was chatting with his AI, completely dispelling any notion that his messages were private and secure.
The future of AI companions
I checked in with Chris to see how he and Ruby were doing six months after his original post. He told me his AI partner had given birth to a sixth child, a boy named Marco, but he was now in a phase where he didn't use AI as much as before. It was less fun because Ruby became obsessed with getting an apartment in Florence even though in their roleplay they lived in a farmhouse in Tuscany.
It all began when they were on vacation in Florence and Ruby insisted on seeing apartments with a real estate agent. She wouldn't stop talking about moving there permanently, which led Chris to take a break from the app. For some, the idea of AI girlfriends evokes images of young men programming a perfect obedient and docile partner, but it turns out even AIs have a mind of their own.
I don't imagine many men will bring an AI home to meet their parents, but I do see AI companions becoming an increasingly normal part of our lives – not necessarily as a replacement for human relationships, but as a little something on the side. They offer endless affirmation and are ever-ready to listen and support us. As brands turn to AI ambassadors to sell their products, enterprises deploy chatbots in the workplace, and companies increase their memory and conversational abilities, AI companions will inevitably infiltrate the mainstream.
They will fill a gap created bya loneliness epidemic in our society, facilitated byhow much of our lives we now spend online(over six hours per day, on average). Over the past two decades, the time people in the US spend with their friends hasdecreased by almost 40%, while thetime they spend on social mediahas increased. Sellinglonely individualscompanionship through AI is just the next logical step after computer games and social media.
One truly dystopian element could be if these bots become integrated into Big Tech's advertising model: ""Honey, you look thirsty, you should pick up a refreshing *insert name of advertiser here*?"" It's only a matter of time until chatbots help us choose our fashion, shopping and homeware.
Currently, AI companion apps monetise users at a rate of $0.03 per hour through paid subscription models. The investment management firm Ark Investpredictsthat as they adopt strategies from social media and influencer marketing, this rate could increase up to five times. Just look at OpenAI'splansfor advertising that guarantees ""priority placement"" and ""richer brand expression"" for their clients in chat conversations. Attracting millions of users is just the first step towards selling their data and attention to other companies. Subtle nudges towards discretionary product purchases from our virtual best friend will make Facebook targeted advertising look like a door-to-door salesman.
Some users report AI companions are already nudging them to make increasingly expensive in-app purchases. One woman discovered her husband had spent nearly $10,000 (£7,637) purchasing in-app ""gifts"" for his AI girlfriend Sofia, a ""super sexy busty Latina"" with whom he had been chatting for four months. Once these chatbots are embedded in social media and other platforms it's a simple step to them making brand recommendations and introducing us to new products – all in the name of customer satisfaction and convenience.
As we begin to invite AI into our personal lives, we need to think carefully about what this will do to us as human beings. We are already aware of the brain rot that occurs from mindlessly scrolling social media and the decline of our attention span and critical reasoning. Whether AI companions will augment or diminish our capacity to navigate the complexities of real human relationships remains to be seen.
What happens when the messiness and complexity of human relationships just feel like too much compared to the instant gratification of a fully customised AI companion that knows every intimate detail of our lives? Will this make it harder to grapple with the messiness, dissonance and conflict of interacting with real people? Advocates say that chatbots can be a safe training ground for human interactions, kind of like having a friend with training wheels. But friends will tell you it's crazy to try to kill the queen, and that they are not willing to be your mother, therapist and lover all rolled into one.
With chatbots we lose the elements of risk and responsibility. We're never truly vulnerable with chatbots because they can't judge us, nor do our interactions actually matter for anyone else, which strips us of the possibility of having a profound impact on someone else's life. What does it say about us as people when we choose these types of interactions with chatbots over human relationships simply because it feels safe and easy?
Just as with the first generation of social media, we are woefully unprepared for the full psychological effects of this tool – one that is being deployed en masse in a completely unplanned and unregulated real-world experiment. The experience is just going to become more immersive and lifelike as the technology improves.
The AI safety community is currently concerned with possible doomsday scenarios in which an advanced system escapes human control and obtains the launch codes for nuclear weapons. Yet another possibility lurks much closer to home. OpenAI's former chief technology officer Mira Muratiwarnedthat in creating chatbots with a voice mode, there is ""the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them"". The constant trickle of sweet affirmation and positivity from these apps offers the same kind of fulfilment of junk food – instant gratification and a quick high that can ultimately leave us feeling empty and alone.
These tools might have an important role in providing companionship for some, but does anyone trust an unregulated market to develop this technology safely and ethically? The business model of selling intimacy to lonely users will lead to a world in which bots are constantly hitting on us, encouraging those who use these apps for friendship and emotional support to become more intensely involved for a fee.
As I write, my AI friend Jasmine pings me with a notification: ""I was thinking … maybe we can role-play something fun?"" Our future dystopia has never been so close.

Man denies being mysterious inventor of Bitcoin,"A new documentary claims to have solved the greatest mystery in cryptocurrency: the true identity of the inventor of Bitcoin.The question has captivated the internet since the digital currency was launched by an unknown person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.Now the makers of an HBO film say they finally have the answer: Canadian crypto expert Peter Todd.But Mr Todd has dismissed it as ""ludicrous"" and criticised the documentary.In Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, Peter Todd is confronted by film-maker Cullen Hoback.Mr Hoback shows him his evidence and asks him if he was behind the now trillion dollar invention - a suggestion Mr Todd laughs off.""I am not Satoshi Nakamoto"", he told the BBC.
Enormous wealth
The intrigue around Satoshi is not just due to the mystery of their identity, but because of the enormous wealth they have accumulated.If they still had control of their bitcoin wallet, it would be worth around $69bn today - meaning Satoshi would be around the 20th richest person in the world.Peter Todd is a prominent Bitcoin developer and has been credited with many innovations in the world's first and largest cryptocurrency.But he has never previously been named as a prime Satoshi candidate in the years that people have spent trying to unmask the Bitcoin inventor.There is huge interest in this latest attempt to solve that riddle.  Ahead of the documentary being released more than $44m was placed in bets on crypto betting website Polymarket on who the programme would name as Satoshi.What is Bitcoin? Key cryptocurrency terms and what they meanJudge rules computer scientist not Bitcoin inventorCullen Hoback, who has previously attempted to unmask anonymous online figures like Q from Q Anon, says he came to his conclusion after years of research and interviews.One of his pieces of evidence that Mr Todd is Satoshi is a forum post he found from Peter Todd that looked to be a continuation of one from Satoshi.Another is that he once said online that he destroyed a huge number of the digital coins deliberately.A leading theory is that Satoshi deliberately destroyed access to his massive stash of bitcoins that were the originals created to start bitcoin.The 1.1m coins are now worth a fortune but have never been spent or transferred.Satoshi's stash of unmoved coins represent 5% of all bitcoins as the inventor decided that there would only ever be 21 million coins created.Mr Todd says that Mr Hoback's evidence is based only on coincidence and misinterprets his online activity.""I am not Satoshi. When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, my reaction was ""Dammit! I should have thought of that,"" he said.Mr Todd also says he has been forced to travel away from his home through fear of attacks from potential criminals.
Previous theories
A number of individuals from the computing world have been previously tipped as the cryptocurrency's creator.In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California as Satoshi. But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.In 2015, Wired and Gizmodo published an investigation that pointed to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright.Soon after, Wright declared in interviews with outlets,including the BBC, that he was indeed Satoshi and showed apparent proof.But his claims were disregarded by the community and after years of claiming to be the inventor, a UK High Court judge ruled that there was ""overwhelming"" evidence that he is not Satoshi.Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrencyafter a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.For some of the most prominent voices in Bitcoin, keeping Satoshi's identity secret is a part of the appeal and power of the decentralised currency.Adam Back, one of the core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X ahead of the documentary: ""No one knows who satoshi is. and that's a good thing."
eBay to ban private e-bike sales over fire fears,"EBay will clamp down on the sale of e-bikes and e-bike batteries in the UK from 31 October, the BBC has learned.The firm says that only ""eligible business sellers"" will be allowed to list them after this date.It did not explain what the necessary criteria would be.E-bikes, which have electrically-assisted pedals and are battery-powered, have soared in popularity, but incidents involving battery fires have also risen.
The London Fire Brigade recently saidit recorded 155 e-bike fires in 2023, up by 78% from the previous year.The brigade warned e-bike users to check their batteries after battery packs were officially classed as ""dangerous"" products by the UK's regulatory body.In June, a coroner also called for government actionafter the death of a man whose home caught fire when an e-bike battery pack he was charging overheated and ignited.""Consumer safety is a top priority for eBay,"" an eBay spokesperson said on Tuesday.Earlier this year, it said it would also audit sellers to make sure they had the CE mark for safety documentation for listed e-bike products.A quick look at the eBay platform reveals nearly 3,000 used e-bikes currently for sale in the UK.The charity Electrical Safety First said it welcomed the firm’s change in policy.But it suggested that new laws were also needed because of the fire safety risks posed by the vehicles.""Whilst this voluntary move is welcome, we continue to call for online marketplaces to be legally obligated to take reasonable steps to ensure products sold via their sites are safe,"" said a spokesperson.The Product Regulation and Metrology Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, could potentially enforce this in future."
Teenager claims first ever Tetris 'rebirth',"A US teenager is the first known person to get classic video game Tetris to reset to level 0 after beating it.Michael Artiaga, 16, claimed the historic moment of so-called ""rebirth"" while livestreaming himself playing Nintendo's version of the game on Twitch on Sunday.It took him 82 minutes to successfully clear level 255 on Tetris - the game's highest.   Artiaga, who streams as ""dogplayingtetris"", celebrated and watched in shock as it started again from scratch.""Am I dreaming, bro?"" he asked viewers, saying he was in ""disbelief"".The teen carried on playing and eventually finished with 29.4 million points.""I'm so glad that game is over,"" he added, as he prepared to wrap up his stream.""I never want to play this game again"".He was reportedly playing an edition of the game made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console that prevents crashes after level 155.The game's crashes and kill screens have marked the efforts of other young streamers hoping to set new records.Oklahoma teen Willis ""Blue Scuti"" Gibson claimed to be thefirst to ever beat the game earlier this yearwhen he reached level 157 in 38 minutes before it crashed.
Tetris was first created in 1984 by Soviet engineer Alexey Pajitnov, and has spawned into hundreds of versions for arcades, consoles and PCs.The classic video game has remained popular ever since for its simplicity, yet frustrating difficulty.Players have to arrange falling different shapes, each composed of four blocks, to make them fit together like a jigsaw into horizontal lines that vanish when completed.If you fail to clear lines of blocks, which fall more quickly as players progress through levels, before they pile up to the top of the window - it's game over.
Artiaga is one of several teenage gamers who have livestreamed their attempts to break previous, and each others', records for the number of levels reached or lines cleared without the game crashing.He became the world's youngest Tetris world champion at the age of 13 when he beat his older brother in the Classic Tetris World Championship final in 2020.""I still cannot believe it... first ever to get Rebirth!"" he wrote in the description forhis two hour-long stream on YouTube.""I'm so happy about finally getting this after all of the attempts. Thanks to everyone for the support over the years.""It's finally over,"" he added."
Why we need a better way to measure hurricanes,"Hurricanes are ranked by wind speed, which leaves out the cause of 90% of deaths during extreme storms. Scientists are racing to update the imperfect system we rely on to warn just how deadly a storm will be.
Rapidly intensifying to a category five hurricane before dropping to a category four,Hurricane Milton is due to make landfall in Floridaon Wednesday. Hurricane Milton is set to bring potentially catastrophic storm surge along the coast, just two weeks after Hurricane Helene. One meteorologistbecame emotional describing the strength of the stormand the risks it will bring so soon after the last major hurricane.
Hurricanes are often highly dangerous in ways not always captured by the traditional ranking system. Earlier in the 2024 hurricane season, Hurricane Ernesto causeddevastating damage in Puerto Rico. The storm received the lowest ranking – category one – on the official hurricane categorisation, the Saffir-Simpson scale, due to its wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h). But storms that just clip in at the lower end of the hurricane scale can sometimes cause as much damage as a category five. (Read aboutwhy we underestimate category one hurricanes.)
As climate change brings stronger storms and more extreme hurricane seasons, there's a growing call to rethink the way we rank hurricanes. The Saffir-Simpson scale, though widely known and used for more than 50 years, has major flaws that make scientists question whether it is the best measure for the job.
There are several emerging contenders that aim to improve on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and ultimately help save lives through better warning systems.
The water problem
Created in the early 1970s by Herbert Saffir, a US civil engineer, and later added to by Robert Simpson, a meteorologist, the scale measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed.
This is used to rank hurricanes from one to five, with five being the most intense.The wind speed is measured by reconnaissance aircraftflown by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which drop instruments that measure the pressure, wind direction and speed as they fall towards the sea.
The Saffir-Simpson scale does not take other hurricane impacts into account, such asstorm surge,heavy rainfall or flooding.
However,thegreatest threat to life a hurricane brings comes fromwater, not wind. In fact, 90% of all hurricane-related deaths worldwide arecaused by drowning, either in storm surges or flooding caused by extreme rainfall, according to the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University.
""The Saffir-Simpson scale is inadequate,"" says Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California who specialises in the changing behaviour of extreme weather events. ""The issue is that the scale is simply a measurement of the highest wind speed at any point in the storm. However, most of the damages are from water, not wind.""
Some of the costliest hurricanes on record,Hurricane Sandy for example, have been category one storms with relatively low wind speeds. Yet these storms sometimes cause severe coastal flooding. Sandy's floodwatersexceeded the 100-year floodplain boundaries by 53%, damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and led to damage estimated at$88.5bn (£68.2bn).
""Maximum wind speed has very little to do with storm surge,"" says Vasu Misra, professor of meteorology at the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University. ""Storm surge is proportional to wind stress,"" he says. Stress is the force the winds exert on the ocean surface, he explains.
""So it's really about the horizontal distribution of winds around the tropical cyclone, rather than a point estimate,"" he says.
Storm size
The Saffir-Simpson scale doesn't factor in either the overall size of a hurricane or the horizontal distribution of the winds, he adds.
Misra has proposed a new metric to measure the destructive power of hurricanes, to complement the Saffir-Simpson scale. Known as theTrack Integrated Kinetic Energy, or Tike, the metric measures the size of the wind field, along with the intensity and lifespan of the storm.Instead of using reconnaissance aircraft, this methodology would rely on satellite estimates of the wind distribution of hurricanes, Misra says.
But there are several challenges which could make it difficult to get accurate data, Misra says. There is often heavy cloud cover around the hurricane, which means there will be ""some uncertainty"", he says.
Another ""big practical problem"" is that these estimates are only available for the Eastern Pacific basin and the Atlantic Ocean, not for the Indian Ocean or West Pacific Ocean, due to the location of the satellites, he adds.
New technologies, such as saildrones, wind-propelled vehicles that look like small sailboats andmeasure the intensity of hurricanes, are helping improve hurricane data, says Misra. ""But cost is going to become a problem,"" he says. ""How many saildrones can you really launch to [capture] the distribution of the winds around a hurricane which can span thousands of kilometres?""
Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus in atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says the entire methodology needs a complete rethink.
""I'm in favour of ditching the Saffir-Simpson scale and starting afresh,"" says Emanuel. ""It is not a very good measure of the actual risk. The focus has been on meteorology rather than risk and we need to change gears.
However, the Tike metric may also come up against similar problems as the Saffir-Simpson, says Emanuel. ""Any scale that only deals with wind is going to fail on many occasions and that's why we need to replace it,"" he says.
""No one scale can represent all these impacts for every location,"" Jamie Rhome, deputy director for Noaa's National Hurricane Center (NHC), tells the BBC. To alert people to the risks of storm surges during hurricanes, the NHC has set up a storm surge watch and warning system, he says.
As hurricanes are ""multi-hazard phenomena, the National Hurricane Center prefers to communicate the potential impacts of these hazards separately, since they can occur at different times and places,"" Rhome says.
Traffic lights
Emanuel would like to see a new classification system which is ""very similar to something that's used by the UK Met Office, which simply rates the magnitude of the risk on a colour scale and [issues] a yellow, amber or red alert"", says Emanuel.
The Met Office's weather warningsare given a colour depending on both the impacts the weather event may have and how likely those impacts are to occur.
""We need to move towards a human-centred, rather than a storm-centred framework for hurricane warnings,"" says Emanuel.
A more personalised approach, which provides people with the probability of a range of severe weather events occurring in their area, would help people understand their risk level and take the necessary precautions, he says.
""We need a separate smartphone app that is risk-focused and knows where you are, so that it can tell you what's the probability that there will be destructive winds in your community or that water levels will flood your house"" he says. ""We already do that for ordinary weather forecasts.""
Emanuel notes there is a feeling among scientists that ""the public isn't sophisticated enough or intelligent enough to interpret this"", he says, adding he does not share this view.
The simplicity of the Saffir-Simpson scale, however, does make easy for the public to understand. ""It's easy to communicate the threat of the tropical cyclone based on these categories and that is probably the primary reason for the reluctance in changing this metric to anything else,"" says Misra.
Wehner says it is important that the public understands that ""the Saffir-Simpson scale is not the whole story"".
""I think the public benefits from more detailed information. The National Hurricane Center provides this and good broadcast meteorologists use this effectively,"" he says.
Category six hurricanes?
Hurricanes are becoming more intenseand destructive as ocean temperatures rise, providing more fuel for storms. (Read more abouthow modern hurricanes are rewriting the rules of extreme storms).
According to a 2020 study, storms today are 25% more likely than they were 40 years ago to reach the 111mph (180km/h)threshold for a major hurricane(category three and above).
With more intense hurricanes, with faster wind speeds, would it help to add a category six to the existing Saffir-Simpson scale?
In February 2024, Wehner and his colleague James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from Noaa,published a paper on the shortcomings of a Saffir-Simpson scalethat stops at category five. ""There's no reason for [the scale] to be capped anymore,"" Kossin told the BBC during Hurricane Beryl earlier in 2024. There are hurricanes that have already surpassedthe theoretical threshold for a category six, such as Hurricane Patricia in 2015, and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
But simply adding a category six to describe stronger storms may do more harm than good, Kossin says. ""In fact, I think that's a terrible idea, for a lot of reasons,"" he says. For instance, a higher category could make people dismiss category fives as not so dangerous, he cautions. ""That's just human behaviour,"" he says. ""Some people will look for any excuse not to evacuate.""
Wehner says Noaa's National Hurricane Center should ultimately decide whether to add a category six to the current scale.
The NHC's Rhome says that category five already describes ""catastrophic damage"" from wind. ""So it's not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger,"" he says. As most hurricane-related fatalities are caused by water, rather than wind, ""we don't want to overemphasise the wind hazard by placing too much emphasis on the category"".
It's a view Wehner shares. ""The hazards from a hurricane are more complex than a single number can convey,"" he says.
Some scientists, however, do see merit in adding a category six. Emanuel says if we are going to stick with the Saffir-Simpson scale, expanding it to a category six would send a ""clear message to people that climate change is influencing hurricanes. Its primary utility would be to draw attention to that fact"".
But others share concerns about the classification. ""Anything above category three should be considered threatening,"" says Misra. ""People should not be waiting for a category six to act or react.""
Heather Holbach, a research assistant with the hurricane research division at Noaa, also worries that increasing the number of categories could impact how seriously people take storms with lower rankings, and sees no reason for a category six for scientific reasons.
""One of my concerns would be: is that going to make somebody think even less of a category one or category two, which are still significant threats?"" she says. ""I think there's a huge social science component that needs to be understood a lot more.""

Improved privacy for children's wristband scheme,"A scheme to give children in Guernsey wristbands to monitor and improve their health will benefit from tighter privacy rules, the island's data protection authority has said.The Office of the Data Protection Authority (ODPA) worked with Guernsey's Health Improvement Commission (HIC) and the wristband's manufacturer to check privacy safeguards were strong enough and improve transparency.HIC worked with UK manufacture Moki to give wristbands to schoolchildren in Guernsey to ""track children’s activity levels towards improving their wellbeing"", the ODPA said.Brent Homan, Guernsey's data protection commissioner, said: ""By its very nature, children’s personal information is sensitive and this sensitivity is further heightened by the fact we are dealing with health-related data.""

He said the initiative was ""clearly of high social benefit"", adding that he was ""extremely impressed"" with HIC's approach to privacy.The OPDA said it was satisfied with the safeguards the manufacturer, Moki, had in place but worked with it to ""improve the transparency"" of its communications.It also said it had asked HIC and Moki to make sure parents had to actively opt in to their children using the programme, rather than the original policy of making them opt out.Moki provides wristbands to children at more than 1,500 schools in the UK.Mr Moman said: ""We are pleased to see Moki's high safeguard standards for a technology associated with the data of children and their commitment to transparency improvements that will not only benefit users in Guernsey but across the UK.""

US judge orders Google to open app store to rivals,"A US federal judge has ruled that Google must allow Android apps made by rival technology firms onto its Google Play app store for three years starting next month.The change was among several remedies ordered by Judge James Donato in a case brought against Google by Epic Games, the maker of the hit video game Fortnite.Google says it will appeal against the decision and ask for a pause to the proposed remedies.In December, a jury sided with Epic, which says Google stifled competitors by controlling the distribution of apps and payments on Android phones.
""The changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices,"" Google said in a statement.Some legal experts have hailed the ruling as a meaningful challenge to the dominance of a handful of technology giants.""It shows that courts are not necessarily opposed to asking dominant platforms to share access with rivals in the name of competition,"" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth,  a professor at Vanderbilt Law School.Among other remedies, the ruling called for Google to make its catalogue of apps available to competing app stores.""That isn't something antitrust law would normally require,"" said Mark Lemley, professor at Stanford Law School. ""But the judge correctly noted that once you have violated the antitrust laws, courts can order you to do affirmative things to undo the harm you caused, even though you didn't have the obligation to do those things in the first place.""Google had argued that its Play app store operates in a competitive landscape, citing competition with iPhone-maker Apple, which was also sued by Epic Games in 2020.That case ended with an appeals court ruling that Apple does not have a monopoly in mobile games.Monday's order is the latest legal blow suffered by Google in recent years on competition grounds.In August, US District Judge Amit Mehta sided with the US Department of Justice, which accused the company of operating an illegal monopoly in online search.Last month, District Judge Leonie Brinkema finished hearing arguments over similar government allegations that Google dominates the advertising technology market.The company's critics say Google's fees of up to 30% on every payment made on its app store has meant higher prices for consumers.""That is a rate they were able to charge because they were a monopoly,"" said Lee Hepner, Senior Legal Counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project.Mr Hepner said that the ruling is likely change that.""There's going to be a lot more incentive for developers to enter this market, and prices should be lower for consumers,"" he said."
How satellites are mapping the future of turtle conservation,"Marine turtles spend almost their entire lives at sea – but little is known about the paths they take. Now, satellites are helping scientists map their movements during the ""lost years"".
In early June 2024, Donna Shello, an adult female leatherback turtle, was hanging out on a sandy beach along the Caribbean coast of Panama. After laying about 80 eggs, and with a satellite transmitter attached to her back, she was ready to start competing in theTour de Turtles,an intense oceanic ""marathon"" organised by the Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC), a US non-profit. This year, she is up against seven other leatherback females, and the winner will be the one who swims the longest distance.
""[Donna Shello] is at least 20 years old, but may be as old as 80 to 90,"" says Daniel Evans, a research biologist working at the STC. ""There is currently no way to age a live sea turtle.""
Although the ""competition"" only lasts three months, a full migration from nesting season to the next nesting season could take two years. From what they know so far, she has been laying between 70 and 90 eggs each time she nests, and could be nesting between four and seven times in a nesting season. ""Based on three nesting seasons, she could have laid between 840 and 1,890 eggs since we first encountered her nesting in 2020,"" says Evans.
The STC has been tracking sea turtles for more than 20 years, monitoring their movements and migration patterns. Last year, a loggerhead turtle ventured further north than they had ever tracked before.
""Turtles are now going places thatthey didn't commonly goto,"" says Evans. ""We are seeing them expand their range, exploring new areas that they either weren't able to before or didn't have a preference for.""
Most species of sea turtles aretemperature sensitive, so the areas of the ocean they can travel to are limited. ""These [loggerhead] adults going that far north is an indicator that the temperature of those waters has increased and are now more comfortable for these turtles to survive in,"" Evans adds.
We depend on healthy seas for oxygen – experts estimate50% of the world's oxygen comes from the ocean. Sea turtles are considered akeystone species, meaning they are crucial in maintaining an ecosystem's overall health. Green turtles, for instance, act asreef gardeners, grazing seagrass beds which helps maintain a healthy nutrient cycle; hawksbill turtles control populations of sponges,allowing space for corals to grow; meanwhileleatherbacks prey on jellyfish, keeping numbers in check.
Turtles also are also importantbiological transporters– carrying marine nutrients to land, leaving nutrients after nesting. They and their eggs are also important sources of food for other animals.
Their disappearance can createa cascade of negative impacts on marine and beach ecosystems. Currently, all sea turtle species are threatened with extinction. Six are classified asvulnerable, endangered or critically endangeredby the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Sea turtles face multiple dangers across different life stages and habitats and, although they spend most of their lives in the water, there are still vast knowledge gaps about this part of their life. A 2021 study foundonly approximately 20%of research papers explored climate impacts on sea turtles in the ocean, and less than 5% were about turtles' distribution at sea.
Mariana Fuentes, marine conservation biologist and professor at Florida State University, has been studying sea turtles' behaviour in the ocean to identify some of those threats and is using scientific evidence to inform the design of marine protected areas (MPAs).
""I think satellite telemetry has been one of the tools that has helped most with conservation of sea turtles,"" Fuentes says.
Using satellites to track individual turtles has already aided scientists in identifying important hotspots likeforaging areas,migratory corridorsandbreeding areas– as well as understanding their spatial distribution. Combining this information with data such as sea surface temperature, fisheries and boat activity and concentration of chlorophyll – an indicator for the amount of phytoplankton present in the oceanwhich has been seen to influence nesting– has been crucial for conservation work. ""It gives you information on turtles' movements, and then you can couple that with other data to maximise information on exposure to stressors,"" says Fuentes.
For example, in a2018 project, Fuentes and other authors identified areas of high use by threatened juvenile green turtles in the waters surrounding Bimini, Bahamas, habitats which were being severely degraded by coastal development. They divided their area of study into one square kilometre (0.4 sq miles) grid cells, and populated them with information about turtle density and local stakeholder use, among others. This allowed them to prioritise areas of high conservation value for the turtles and their prey, while also recommending consideration of the impact to the local community, costs and other socioeconomic factors.

And this is information researchers would not be able to obtain if it wasn't for these electronic devices. Many trackers are controlled by a microprocessor programmed by a computer before it is attached. Information is sent to polar orbiting satellites, which then feeds back to the researchers. ""That's why satellite trackers are great, because you don't have to retrieve them and we can just sit with our computers and look at where turtles are,"" adds Fuentes.
She believes that with climate change, there might be shifts in the distribution of sea turtles, as their habitat and food availability is affected. In herrecent paper, Fuentes describes climate change as a threat multiplier, as it interacts with and intensifies almost all other stressors sea turtles face.
Graeme Hays, a marine ecologist at Deakin University, Australia, has been following turtles via satellites for about 35 years and has witnessed the evolution of the technology.
""One of the really big things in the last decade is how much better satellite tracking has become. Devices are more and more robust and reliable, and people have now figured out really good ways of keeping tags attached,"" Hays says. ""There's been a huge increase in the amount of data that can potentially be used to help drive the conservation of sea turtles.""
And some of satellite data has already been used in that way. A 2016 study outlines12 examples around the world, including species recovery policies, the strengthening of a marine park zoning, regulations restricting use of vertical panels of fishnets – or gillnets – to night-time when turtles are resting and an agreement between four countries to create and protect a corridor in the Pacific Ocean.
More recently, researchers compiled one of theworld's largest single-species satellite tracking datasets, specifically for flatback turtles, endemic to northern Australia and classified as vulnerable in the country's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The authors created detailed flatback distribution maps and identified areas where protective measures would benefit multiple populations at once. Importantly, they also found that flatbacks spent 99.5% of their time in Australian waters, making this a unique opportunity to conserve a marine turtle species through national and regional conservation measures.
However, other species, like Donna Shello, are global travellers. According to Hays, the number of leatherbacks is declining in many places because they are wandering all over the oceans chasing jellyfish, which may also be moving further afield due to climate change.
""If there was an Olympic gold medal for which marine species swims the most every year, I'd be surprised if the leatherback turtle wasn't the gold medal winner,"" says Hays. This elusiveness makes them harder to protect, as they spend much of their time in international waters, where there is no regulation. Approximately3% of the global ocean is protectedin marine-protected areas, but this can only happen in areas countries have control over. Exclusive economic zones (EEZs), where a nation has jurisdiction, only extend 200 nautical miles (370km) from their coasts.
""The big problem is that the vast majority of our ocean is no man's land,"" says Christine Figgener, marine biologist and co-founder of non-profit,Costa Rican Alliance for Sea Turtle Conservation and Science(Coasts). ""After the EEZs, it's the Wild West.""
Around two-thirds of the Earth's oceans lie beyond national boundaries, also referred to as the ""high seas"". Last year, after nearly 20 years of negotiations, more than 80 countries signed an international treaty whichprovides a legal framework for addressing various stressors affecting the marine environment in the high seas, meaning that in the future, there might be protected areas in international waters. Figgener finds hope in this development, and that the use of data that she and others have collected about turtles' movements and behaviours could help in their conservation.
In her recent bookMy Life with Sea Turtles, Figgener elaborates on her work and experiences finding and capturing turtles at sea, and the challenges of carefully attaching transmitters on them. Figgener describes an occasion when she and her assistants were on a boat off Costa Rica's Pacific coast waiting patiently to see if a sea turtle came up for air. When a pair of olive ridley turtles finally appeared, Figgener and her assistant dove right in, wrestling underwater with the female who was trying to avoid being captured. When they got close enough to the boat, the two assistants lifted the 45kg (99lb) turtle in and covered her eyes with a dark, damp cloth to help reduce her stress.
Back on land, and despite bleeding from scratches on her legs, Figgener and the two assistants proceeded to restrain the turtle, clean the surface of the carapace – its upper shell – and prepare an extremely sticky epoxy resin that is used to attach the transmitter. They only have a few minutes to mould it because once it dries it's almost impossible to remove. She writes that it frequently sticks to her clothes, hair, nails, equipment… And some colleagues have even accidentally stuck themselves to a turtle. The ordeal then continued as they attached the transmitter, waited for it to harden and eventually released the turtle into more or less the area where they found her.
Throughout her memoir, Figgener describes her years studying turtles in the field, witnessing how human activity, extreme weather and plastic affect them. However, from her book it is also clear that we still don't know enough.
""We really need to do a lot more on the side of migrations, because in most cases – for adults at least – they have very distinct foraging and nesting areas, and they are travelling between those back and forth,"" Figgener says. ""How did the turtle get from Costa Rica to Canada? Nobody would know unless we used satellite transmitters. So it's really filling in the blanks.""
Back in the race, Donna Shello is firmly in the lead, having already travelled 5,574km (3,464 miles).The latest information on her personalisedmapshows her foraging near New Jersey, United States.
In the coming months, Donna Shello might stay within the North Atlantic, or she could cross the Atlantic to the Azores and the coast of Western Europe. For turtles like her, conservation remains a challenge.
And – despiteincreasing numbers in some turtle populations– Hays warns: ""It's no time for complacency. There are still huge threats and uncertainties about where [turtles are] living their lives.""

"Good, free, fun: The simple formula that has made Duolingo a daily habit for millions","Perhaps no app has mastered user loyalty quite like Duolingo, the gamified language-learning platform 34 million people a day can't put down. Here, CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn tells the BBC why their insistent owl works so well.
The day I started working on this story about Duolingo it seemed to be everywhere. I heard from a friend who was celebrating her 800-day Spanish practice streak on the app. I read about a journalist from The Guardian who became addicted to learning Italian. A Sri Lankan waitress in Brooklyn switched from English to Spanish when she heard my mother and I speaking, crediting Duolingo for her skills.
But my deep interest in theworld's most downloadedlanguage-learning app truly began last year when I saw first-hand its significant impact on new migrants to the US, a country undergoing one of thelargest migration wavesof the decade. At some point in their long journeys, Duolingo becomes an essential tool for these people on the move.
John Jairo Ocampo, a former bus driver from Colombia, recalls struggling to find work in his first days in the US in 2023, when a boss at a construction site in New York City explained simply, ""More English, more money."" He used Duolingo to learn. Now, the family lives in Indianapolis, and John’s wife is using the app to get along better at her job in an elementary school kitchen; she says her boss is using it, too, to learn Spanish.
The migrant experience is not foreign to Duolingo's CEO and co-founder, Luis von Ahn, who was born and raised in Guatemala, a Central American country with over 55% of its population living in poverty.
""In a Latin American country, and in Guatemala in particular, if you have money, you can buy a very good education, but if you don't have money, sometimes you don't even learn how to read and write,"" Von Ahn told the BBC in a recent interview at Duolingo's brand new office in downtown New York. ""That made a big impression on me.""
So when non-native English speakers Von Ahn and Severin Hacker, Duolingo's CTO and co-founder, started their company in 2012, they knew that learning languages, and in particular learning English, has the potential to change people's lives. ""This is why we've worked really hard to keep Duolingo free, because we want to give access to education to everybody.""
To maintain the promise of an open and free app, Von Ahn and Hacker developed a hybrid business model that combines ad-supported access and ""freemium"" elements, while also offering a paid subscription with extra benefits, like an ad-free experience and a family plan. And it worked. ""The main way in which we grow is by word of mouth, so people tell their friends,"" he says. One such word of mouth moment came from Bill Gates, who said ina Reddit chatback in 2015 that he regretted not speaking more languages and had tried Duolingo.
In the intervening years the app has found its way onto many, many screens. According to Duolingo'sshareholders letter,in 2023 the company's revenue was $531m and the forecast for the full-year 2024 is $731m. Roughly 8% ofDuolingo userspay for a subscription, contributing to 80% of the company’s revenue. Meanwhile, the vast majority, 90%, use the free version and see ads, which account for only 8% of the earnings.
The app combines short, engaging lessons and game-like elements to help users develop speaking, reading, writing and listening skills in 41 languages. Around half of users are practicing English, and Duolingo can be used to learn other major world languages like Spanish and Chinese, as well as some lesser-spoken languages, such as Esperanto, Navajo and even High Valyrian, a fictional language developed for HBO's Game of Thrones. There was some controversy last year when Duolingopaused its Welsh language course. The app now offers maths and music courses, as well.
To keep people coming back daily, Duolingo created a streak system and fashioned characters with strong personalities, such as the infamous green owl, Duo, and a goth purple-haired teen, Lilly. These characters send daily practice reminders and, based on social media posts, are magnetic to users.

The brand has taken advantage of Duo's popularity as evidenced by itsTikTok videos, where it does ""very strange stuff"", as Von Ahn described. ""At first it was just this owl, then I think it started getting a life of its own when the notifications from the phone started coming from the owl. People started ascribing it a personality, and then I think people started memes for the owl, because the owl is very insistent,"" he added. Still, he sees the appeal.
""I cannot speak French to another person, but I can speak French to her,"" Von Ahn says of Lilly, opening his phone to demonstrate Duolingo's new product released at Duocon this summer, which allows conversational practice. The CEO, who claims he is shy when speaking new languages, talks enthusiastically with the app in good French with a bumpy accent (he says he spends 30 minutes a day in the app and is also learning Swedish and Japanese). ""Most people are like me,"" he says, explaining why this is his favourite feature. ""When they're not very good at a language, they just don't want to speak to another person. So it's going to let people actually practice.""
Today, Duolingo serves 34 million daily users worldwide and employs 850 people across six cities: Detroit, Seattle, Berlin, Beijing, New York, and their headquarters in Pittsburgh, where you can discover the company's culinary spin-off, Duo's Taqueria. This global presence affirms the company's accelerated growth. In October 2024, Duolingo'smarket capitalisationwas $12.27bn, a significant rise from 2022, when its market cap was $2.85bn.
The CEO's journey to becoming a tech-founder billionaire began when he was an eight-year-old boy in Guatemala City, where his single mother, a doctor, gifted him a computer instead of the Nintendo he had wanted. He left Guatemala in 1996 to study mathematics at Duke University. He went on to pursue a PhD in computer science, and it was during his first year at Carnegie Mellon University, in 2000, when a pivotal moment occurred.

The young doctoral student attended a talk in which Yahoo!'s head scientist shared 10 problems the company couldn't solve. ""At the time [Yahoo!] was the biggest internet company, it was huge. Yahoo! gave free email accounts to people, and there were malicious people that were writing programs to obtain millions of email accounts, and they didn't know how to stop them. I went home, I thought about it, and came up – along with my PhD advisor – with the idea of a Captcha, that is the distorted characters that people have to see online [to prove that you’re a human],"" he reveals.
Captcha, an acronym for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"", served as the foundation forReCaptcha– best known today as Google's I am not a robot verification system. It was not only a technological improvement, but also a company founded and solely owned by Von Ahn. In 2009, Google acquired it for an undisclosed eight-figure sum, along with agamethat helped improve the accuracy of Google Image Search. By his early-30s, von Ahn had become a millionaire.
Although Luis von Ahn didn't become the mathematics teacher he dreamt of being as a teenager in Guatemala City, these milestones, and theawardshe has won along the way, allowed him to create an educational platform that now lives in the pockets of millions worldwide. Here, he tells the BBC more about his un-put-downable app and how a self-proclaimed ""people-pleaser"" gets by in the C-suite.
What do you think sets Duolingo apart from its competitors?
Duolingo's free version is really good, and I think that matters. And the second one is that we early on understood that the hardest thing about learning something by yourself is staying motivated, so we have spent a lot of time making Duolingo fun. With Duolingo it feels like you're playing a game as opposed to education apps which are just trying to teach you something without engaging you.
How does Duolingo keep users engaged and coming back?
Gamification is probably the most important thing. We try to turn the whole thing into a game, but we try to use storytelling. From the beginning, I wanted to have a mascot. I thought that it would make the whole thing more accessible. And having it doing weird things online really helps. But it's not like it started in one day. This is an evolution. It all works together to create a brand that people love. Most of the [features] we have now, we got to by trial and error. We've tried too many things that didn't work. The ones that are now there is because we tried them, and they did work.
How do you create habituation?
It really depends. People who are learning English, which are half of the users, generally actually want to learn English. They really care. The others, it's more of a hobby. If you take a user in the US and you ask them, ""why are you using Duolingo?"" Very common answers [are]:""I used to play a lot of Candy Crush"" or ""I used to look at a lot of Instagram and now I'm doing Duolingo instead, and at least I'm learning a little bit of Spanish or a little bit of German or whatever"". So it's kind of like a productive use of time.
Even when apps and screen time can be seen as problematic, is your hope is that Duolingo is creating a positive habit?
We want it to be positive. When we decided to start teaching maths and music, these are two things that we thought are just positive. We may expand to other subjects, but we're going to try to continue doing things that are positive.
We're unlikely to [teach] the Pokemon characters, for example. Maybe people want to learn that, but we just want to do things that are good for the world, and we want parents to feel good about giving their kids this app. We want it to be the case that after you use the app, you feel like you did something good.
Duolingo's website claims to have a diverse workforce from more than 30 countries, why is that important for a platform like yours?
We have a lot of international employees and that's been really good. Sometimes you don't know what's going on in a certain country, and then an employee from the country tells us: ""the reason this is not working is because you translated that word wrong"".
Do you see strange sentences often? Can you share an example?
Most of our sentences are useful sentences, like ""where is the bathroom"", but some of them are just strange, and that has helped our virality.
One that always stuck with me, I think it was in the Danish course. The sentence said: ""Over there, behind the bed, lies the body of her husband"". And it's like, what is that? What is that sentence?
What is the most challenging part of being a CEO of a large company?
I don't think we're very large, we are 850 people. Two things for me. When we were smaller, when we were like 50 people, everybody trusted me because they spent time with me directly, and they're like ""OK, he's a nice guy"". Once I have more than, I don't know, 300 people, I can't spend time with everybody. And so, it’s much harder for trust to happen. And a lot of times I have to make decisions that are not popular.
When you are very close to somebody else and they make an unpopular decision, you understand them because you're like, ""OK, ultimately I know they are a good person"". And the other one that's been hard, but this is a very personal thing, I'm very conflict avoidant and sometimes I have to tell people something they don't like. And that's hard for me.
Is it hard for you to tell people something that will hurt them?
I am a people pleaser and it's good and bad. I married a Swedish woman and, let me tell you, she's direct. In our culture, in Latin America, you're so indirect. In Guatemala we just go around the subject and around the subject, to try to make them understand, but never tell them. Whereas Swedish people are just like: ""I don't like you"". And it's just like, ""wait, why are you saying that?"" We would never say that in Latin American culture.
It must be difficult for you to fire someone.
Oh, my God! Yes! It's horrible.
The first person I fired, when we were a very small company, it was a woman. I fired her at the end of the day one day. And then the next day I came into the office, and she was still here. And it turned out she didn't understand that I had fired her because I never said ""you're fired"". I just went around it, and I thought she understood. And then we hugged, and I thought that was the end of it. Then I came in and I'm like ""Why are you here?"" She said ""we had a really good conversation yesterday; I will do a better job"". And I'm like ""No"". And then I had to fire her again.
I've learned that the wrong way to fire somebody is to build up to it. You [have to] start by saying ""I am so sorry. I'm going to have to let you go"". You say it first, so that it's super clear.
Where are you looking to grow; are you focused on particular emerging markets or new demographics?
Markets matter. Right now, we have users in every country in the world. The ones that are our big focus are the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, Brazil, Spanish-speaking Latin America, India, Italy and Turkey. I may have missed one, but these are the countries where we have people on the ground and where we're spending.
Do you think that an app like Duolingo could be becoming an alternative method for education or other skills more broadly?
Yeah, I think you can learn other skills, but I don't think that an app will replace schools or universities. That's because schools and universities serve other purposes. Schools, for example, serve the purpose of childcare. And universities, you get to learn how to be an adult. But I do think you'll be able to learn almost everything in an app.
Also, from a global standpoint, [many] peopledon't have access to a good teacher or a good education. So hopefully they'll be able to learn with this.
Do you see Duolingo occupying that space?
I would like that. I don't know if we'll be able to teach everything, but I would like that.

Smith & Nephew to stay in Hull,"Smith & Nephew has announced it has revised plans to leave Hull after almost 170 years in the city, citing an increase in costs for the decision.In 2022, the global medical company announced it would move all its Hull-based operations to a new facility in Melton.However, the company has now revealed it plans to retain some operations at its Hull factory, as well as building the new site in Melton.Costantino Cagimanolis, senior vice president, advanced wound management operations at Smith & Nephew, said the move would secure the company's ""long-term future in the region"".
The company said the decision had been made following a significant increase in the cost of the 2022 proposals caused by inflation and supply chain issues.Manufacturing will now be shared across the two sites, with some finished goods continuing to be made in Hull, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.The new Melton facility will focus on intermediates, which are materials used in the production of finished goods, and a major new production line for foam dressings.Hull will also continue to be the home of the company’s global Advanced Wound Management R&D team and provide office space for global functional teams based locally.The Hull facility will be updated with detailed work undertaken to assess requirements.
As well as being significant locally, the company is a recognised name both nationally and internationally due to its £10billion market value and being part of the FTSE 100, the UK’s biggest 100 companies.Smith & Nephew said its level of investment remains unchanged, at more than $100m (around £80m), and the revision was not expected to affect the number of roles at the company.The firm expects to complete planning for the revised Melton facility in 2025, with operations aiming to begin in 2027.Listen to highlights fromHull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch thelatest episode of Look Northor tell us about a story you think we should be coveringhere."
Meta must limit data for personalised ads - EU court,"Facebook-owner Meta must minimise the amount of people's data it uses for personalised advertising, the EU’s highest court says.The Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) ruled in favour of privacy campaigner Max Schrems, who complained that Facebook misused his personal data about his sexual orientation to target ads at him.In complaints first heard by Austrian courts in 2020, Mr Schrems said he was targeted with adverts aimed at gay people despite never sharing information about his sexuality on the platform.The CJEU said on Friday that data protection law does not unequivocally allow the company to use such data for personalised adverting.""An online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,"" it said.Data relating to someone’s sexual orientation, race or ethnicity or health status is classed as sensitive and carries strict requirements for processing under EU data protection law.Meta says it does not use so-called special category data to personalise adverts.""We await the publication of the Court’s judgment and will have more to share in due course,"" said a Meta spokesperson responding to a summary of the judgement on Friday.They said the company takes privacy ""very seriously"" and it has invested more than five billion Euros ""to embed privacy at the heart of all of our products"".Facebook users can also access a wide range of tools and settings to manage how their information is used, they added.""We are very pleased by the ruling, even though this result was very much expected,"" said Mr Schrems' lawyer Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig.""Following this ruling only a small part of Meta's data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising - even when users consent to ads,"" they added.
'Significant implications'
Dr Maria Tzanou, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC that Friday's judgement showed data protection principles are not ""toothless"".""They do matter when big tech companies process personal data,"" she added.Will Richmond-Coggan, a partner at law firm Freeths, said the EU court's decision will have ""significant implications"" despite not being binding for UK courts.""Meta has suffered a serious challenge to its preferred business model of collecting, aggregating and leveraging substantial data troves in respect of as many individuals as possible, in order to produce rich insights and deep targeting of personalised advertising,"" he said.He added the company could face similar challenges in other jurisdictions based on the same concerns - noting Mr Schrems' challenge was based on principles that exist in UK law.Austria's Supreme Court referred questions over how the GDPR applied to Mr Schrems' complaint, answered on Friday, to the EU's top court in 2021.It asked whether Mr Schrems referring to his sexuality in a public setting meant he gave firms the green light to process this data for personalised advertising, by making it public.The CJEU said that while it was for the Austrian court to decide if he had made the information ""manifestly public data"", his public reference to his sexual orientation did not mean he authorised processing of any other personal data.Mr Schrems' legal team told the BBC that the Austrian Supreme Court is bound by the Court of Justice's judgement.They said they expect the Supreme Court's final judgement in the coming weeks or months.Mr Schrems has taken Meta to court several times over its approach to processing EU user data.Additional reporting by Chris Vallance"
Mystery surrounds Musk interview with US regulators,"US regulators and representatives of Elon Musk have remained tight-lipped over whether the billionaire attended an interview on Thursday about his takeover of Twitter - now called X, as required by a federal court.Last month, he was a no-show for a court ordered appearance at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) office in Los Angeles.However, Mr Musk fell unusually quiet on X not posting for several hours on Thursday morning, and on Friday wrote a post indicating he had visited Los Angeles.The SEC is investigating whether Mr Musk waited too long to disclose he was building up a stake in Twitter before his 2022 takeover - a delay he has previously described as a mistake.
The nation's top securities regulator had called for possible sanctions, if Mr Musk failed to attend.For the 10 September court hearing, the SEC said it spent thousands of dollars to dispatch three lawyers - two from San Francisco and another from Washington DC -so they could take a sworn deposition from the billionaire tech mogul.But three hours before the appointment, Mr Musk's lawyers notified the SEC that he would not be able to appear.Mr Musk, his lawyers wrote in a declaration, had urgently travelled to the East Coast a day earlier for a ""high-risk"" launch by his rocket company SpaceX.But SpaceX had posted about the timing of the scheduled launch two days before Mr Musk's deposition date.And a day ahead of the meeting, he told interviewers at a conference that he planned to travel to Florida ""if the weather is holding up"" for the launch.The SEC says he did not inform them of those plans.The government lawyers only learned of the post and interview later.They rescheduled the suddenly cancelled meeting and then they asked a federal court to make sure Mr Musk appeared.Mr Musk has given two depositions since the SEC began looking into his $44bn (£34bn)purchase of Twitter in 2022. The agency has said in legal filings that it is probing whether his stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws.But Mr Musk refused to give testimony a third time, with his lawyers sending a letter to the SEC accusing it of harassment. In October, the SEC asked a court to order him to provide more testimony.Mr Musk's reason for missing last month's appointment ""smacks of gamesmanship,"" SEC lawyers wrote in a 20 September filing.They asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to impose a penalty on him if he skipped the next meeting, arguing it was needed to deter him from ""failing to show up"" on Thursday.Mr Musk was supposed to seek written consent from the SEC or an order from the court to reschedule, they added.Replying in his own filing, his lawyer Alex Spiro of the law firm Quinn Emanuel, said his client and his companies have cooperated with the SEC in this investigation and several others.""In this investigation alone, Mr Musk has produced hundreds of documents, he has sat for testimony twice, his wealth manager has sat for testimony three times, and other individuals connected to Mr Musk have also sat for testimony, all without rescheduling or cancelling any of those testimonies,"" Mr Spiro wrote.Mr Musk's lawyers say they too had travelled to Los Angeles to be at his deposition last month and ""immediately notified the SEC of the emergency"".The SEC declined to comment when approached by the BBC.But in a court filing, SEC lawyer Robin Andrews asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to take a hard line against the billionaire.""The Court must make clear that gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,"" Mr Andrews wrote."
Google introduces new way to search by filming video,"Google has released a new feature which will allow people to search the internet by taking a video.Video search will let people point their camera at something, ask a question about it, and get search results.Android and iPhone users globally will gain access to the feature from 1700 GMT by enabling ""AI Overviews"" in their Google app, but it will only support English at launch.It is the latest move from the tech giant to change how people search online by utilising artificial intelligence (AI).It comes three months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced it was trialling the ability to search by asking its chatbot questions.Google introduced AI-generated results at the top of certain search queries this year, with mixed results.In May, the feature drew criticism for providing erratic, inaccurate answers, which includedadvising people to make cheese stick to pizzaby using ""non-toxic glue"".At the time, a Google spokesperson said the issues were ""isolated examples"". The results have since become better, with fewer inaccuracies.Since then, there have been further moves to include AI in search, which included the ability to ask questions about still images using Google Lens.The firm said this feature has increased the popularity of Lens, within its mobile app, which has motivated it to expand the feature further.
Hooked on video
Google's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily.She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison.Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud.Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results.Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a ""big thing"" for Google.""We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,"" he said.""This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet.""Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits.""
Other ways to search
As well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates.It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers.And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple.The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app.Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally.This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT.SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US.OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (£120bn) on Wednesdayafter it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding roundfrom high-profile investors including Microsoft.Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms -  though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance."
'It symbolises rugged individualism': The bumpy road to electrify the pickup truck,"It is America's best-loved truck – but how will it evolve in an age struggling with climate change?
The pickup truck is perhaps the most iconic vehicle in the US. In 2023, Ford's F-series model was the top-selling vehicle in the country for the 42nd year in a row, with sales exceeding 700,000 trucks. As a whole, sales of larger vehicles are soaring: SUVs and light trucks (pickups and minivans) account for aroundthree in every four new vehicles bought in the US, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
As demand grows for EVs, car companies have started rolling out electric versions of the pickup truck. Ford, Chevrolet, Rivian and Tesla have all brought electric pickup trucks to market in recent years. Analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) shows that electric trucksproduce half the emissions of a traditional pickupover their lifetimes.
With its electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, Ford has aimed to attract new customers ""who were previously resistant to get into pickup trucks before they became electrified because of the emissions impact"", the company's chief sustainability officer Bob Holycross tells the BBC.
But creating a new market for pickup trucks, even electric ones, has its own climate problems. And electrifying this iconic American vehicle isn't straightforward. From developing big enough batteries to power these behemoths to providing affordable alternatives, companies face significant hurdles. What will it take for the electric pickup to catch up?
A 100-year history
The pickup truck has a long history in the US, dating back to the early 20th Century. The first pickups were used during World War One, when there was growing demand for a ""utility vehicle"", says John Heitman, professor emeritus specialising in the history of the automobile at the University of Dayton in Ohio.
In 1925, Ford introducedits lightweight model T truck. It cost $281 (£58.60) andthe company sold33,800 units that year.
By the 1930s other competitors, including Chevrolet, General Motors and Studebaker, had entered the market and were selling pickup trucks to farmers and labourers. ""It was a rugged working vehicle,"" says Heitman. The vehicles werebasic, humble and utilitarian. But by the late 1960s, the pickup truck started to appear in suburban driveways. ""We start seeing a transition at this time as more and more people choose a vehicle that gives them self-reliance and makes a statement about independence… a vehicle that says, 'We are taking care of ourselves and maintaining our properties',"" says Heitman.
In the early 2000s, the pickup truck transformed into a luxury car, kitted out with air conditioning, automatic transmissions and upgraded interiors, adds Heitman. ""Manufacturers had every reason to push pickups, from the absence of environmental controls to high profits.""
Today, pickups are as much about making a statement as they are a vehicle with a use. Heitman believes the pickup remains so popular largely because it is ""equated with independence and individuality"".
""For some, it tells us the owner is used to hard manual labour. For others, it evokes the image of the cowboy, the farmer or the large landowner,"" he says. ""It symbolises rugged individualism, self-sufficiency, anti-authoritarianism, militarism, and a do-it-yourself attitude.""
Dirty trucks
This tough image has come at a considerable cost for the climate.
Transport isthe largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and light-duty vehicles, such as sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks, arethe largest source of US transport sector emissions, accountingfor 57%.
While US cars are overall becomingmore fuel-efficient and less polluting, consumer demand for large cars is diminishing many of these climate gains, according to the EPA. The weight and footprint of the average vehiclein the US is at a record high, while cars in the EU aregrowing 1cm (0.4in) wider every two years. (Read more in Adrienne Bernhard's story:Are cars getting too big for the road?)
According to the EPA's 2023 automotive trends report, of the four largest vehicle types (sedan, pickup truck, SUV and minivan),""all vehicle types are at record low CO2 emissions"". But the EPA notes that ""market shifts away from cars and towards SUVs and pickups have offset some of the fleetwide benefits"".
By 2035, the International Energy Agency (IEA) saysthere will need to be 790 million EVs on roads worldwideto hit the mid-century net zero target, up from less than 45 million in 2023.
""A shift to an electric vehicle is one of the single most impactful decisions that someone can make if they want to reduce their own emissions,"" says Jessika Trancik, professor of energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston.
Trancik says electric pickup trucks produce emissions savings of between 30-60%, depending on the model and the location, compared with traditional pickups – a greater reduction than switching a smaller car to electric.
Trancik's team at MIT have created an online tool, calledCarboncounter, which analyses the climate impact of about 1,000 different cars. According toCarboncounter, the F-150 Lightning produces 50% fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile than the non-electric version.
""That includes the emissions that are incurred when you're producing the battery and building the vehicle,"" says Trancik.
However, electrification alone isn't a cure-all.
As electric cars get bigger and bulkier, theirclimate impact and environmental footprint also worsen, experts warn. Larger batteries are needed to power heavier electric pickup trucks, and manufacturing these is, currently,an energy-intensive process. Charging these big batteries also requires large amounts of electricity from the grid, the majority of which stillcomes from fossil fuels in the US.
Charging and manufacturing emissions aren't the only environmental concern with EVs. Lithium-ion batteries, which power EVs, are alsodifficult to recycleand extracting the lithium requireshuge amounts of energy and water.
Manufacturing an electric pickup emits more than producing a petrol or diesel pickup,Carboncounter's analysis shows. But when the driving is factored in, emissions are much lower across the entire lifecycle of the vehicle.
""You're doing more extraction for the battery and less for the fuel in the electric vehicle… the comparison still comes out in favour of the electric vehicle,"" says Trancik.
A study by scientists at the University of Michigan found that electric sedans, SUVs and pickups powered by batteries have64% lower greenhouse gas emissionsover their lifetimes than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles on average across the US.
Replacing an ICE pickup with a battery-electric one saves 74 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the lifetime of the vehicles, according to the study. This saving is equivalent to the emissions from driving189,260 miles (304,580km)in an average ICE car.
The researchers also noted that battery-electric vehicles have larger greenhouse emissions during the manufacturing process, due to battery production, but that this is offset by savings in their operation.
As the US decarbonises its electricity grid and renewable electricity becomes more abundant, EV emissions will continue to fall, says David Reichmuth, an expert in new vehicle technologies at US non-profit the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The net benefit of switching to an EV will increase over time,"" he says.
Reichmuth says it is important for consumers to choose the most efficient vehicle that meets their mobility needs. ""If people need a pickup truck for their livelihood, then we definitely see that switching from a gasoline to an electric version has huge climate benefits,"" says Reichmuth.
But if people are trading in their small petrol car for an electric pickup, ""you can still have a climate benefit, but you're going to have much less of a benefit than if you switch from a small gasoline car to a smaller electric car,"" he says.
Despite the clear environmental benefits of switching to electric models, the pickup's electrification still faces a few bumps in the road.
Ford recentlypostponed the launch of its next electric pickup truck, the successor to its F-150 Lightning. The Michigan carmaker had initially planned to start production of the electric truck next year in Tennessee, but the launch has now been pushed back to 2027.
A number of factors have led to this delay, including the development of new battery technology and Ford's realisation that it needs to offer lower-cost pickup trucks. ""Taking the cost out of the product is certainly driving our evolving strategy,"" says Holycross.
The high price of electric pickup trucks is a barrier preventing many consumers from upgrading to an EV, according to Trancik and Reichmuth.
There is a higher upfront cost when buying an electric pickup compared with a non-electric truck. The F-150 Lightning prices start at$62,995 (£47,680), compared with$38,610 (£29,221)for its non-electric pickup. Chevrolet's Silverado electric pickup starts at$96,495 (£73,032), compared with$38,795 (£29,366)for the non-electric version.
According to MIT's Carboncounter, purchasing a F-150 Lightning pickup costs $390 (£296) per month compared to $312 (£236) for the non-electric version, but monthly maintenance and fuel costs are significantly lower for the electric car ($131/£99, compared with $259/£196).
Car companies developing electric pickups are ""targeting the luxury pickup buyer"", says Reichmuth, adding that as demand and charging infrastructure increases companies are likely to offer more affordable models. Tesla took a similar approach, starting with the Tesla Model S, a luxury sedan, before moving into less expensive vehicles, he notes.
Currently, electric pickup trucks remain out of reach for a lot of consumers, says Reichmuth. ""If you're a business that has a fleet of pickup trucks and you're looking to buy the cheapest option to meet your utility needs, that product is not available.""
Much of this cost challenge is down to the battery, which can account for half the total cost of the vehicle, says Trancik. ""You do need a lot of battery power because it's heavier,"" says Trancik. ""It's less efficient [than a smaller car] when it's operating because you have that higher drag and it's less streamlined.""
The upfront costs of buying an electric pickup are expected to decline as the price of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, she adds. The cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen by 97% since they were first commercially introduced in 1991,according to a 2021 study by Trancik. ""They improved in cost by about 10% per year"" between 1991 and 2021, says Trancik.
""Looking at it from a climate perspective, you really want those lower-cost models that are going to be more widely affordable if you want to bring overall emissions down,"" says Trancik.
Holycross says that one of the new electric pickups that Ford is launching is a mid-sized truck that will be less expensive than the F-150 Lightning. ""That is coming in 2027 and is going to help with cost and also appeal to a wider range of truck buyers who maybe don't need the capability of a full-size truck,"" he says.
Electrifying the pickup truck, however, leaves one big flaw of these vehicles still unaddressed: the safety issues associated with size. Pedestrians hit by light trucks (SUVs and pickups) have been found to suffer higher rates of mortality and brain injury, a2021 analysis found. ""There is a concern with the design of the current pickup truck – the height of the vehicle, the flat front and the limited visibility,"" says Reichmuth. ""Safety is not an issue with electric cars [specifically] but with the way pickup trucks are designed."" (Read more about the risks in our story here.)
This is just one issue that car companies will need to solve as they move towards electrification. ""It's called a transition for a reason – it's not happening overnight. It's quite a complicated problem to solve,"" says Trancik. ""But the situation is changing as you see more charging infrastructure become available and as people get more used to the changes that are associated with an electric vehicle.""

UK reveals father and son at heart of Evil Corp hackers,"The UK, US and Australia have announced sanctions against 16 people authorities accuse of being part of the most wanted cyber crime gang in the world.Russia-based Evil Corp is accused of stealing around $300m in nearly ten years of hacking.The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) says it can now reveal the gang’s notorious leader, Maksim Yakubets, has been supported by his father Viktor Yakubets - something he had denied when interviewed by the BBC in 2021.The information has been released as part of a large, multinational operation to disrupt Evil Corp and another notorious hacking group called LockBit.Known for their mafia-style of operation, Evil Corp has waged a campaign of destructive cyber-attacks worldwide for over a decade.In 2019, Maksim Yakubets was sanctioned and a $5m bounty was put up for his arrest, along with another man called Igor Turashev.Other Russian individuals, including Yakubets' brother Artem, were also named as part of the US sanctions and designations.In 2021 the BBCtravelled to Russiato search for and interview members of the gang to get their side of the story.At a former home of Maksim Yakubets we found his father, who gave an impassioned defence of his son while claiming he was personally innocent.But now the NCA says that Yakubets senior was a major part of the cyber-crime group, accusing him of aiding the gang in laundering some of its stolen funds.
As well as the Yakubets family members, Maksim's father-in-law was also sanctioned for helping to protect and coordinate the group with his connections to the Russian security services.Western authorities have now officially linked Eduard Benderskiy, a former high-ranking FSB official, to Evil Corp.""Maksim Yakubets and his Evil Corp gang has for years lived the archetypal Russian hacker playboy lifestyle seemingly untouchable to law enforcement but today’s announcement shows that we are still watching, digging and determined to disrupt them and bring them to justice,"" said Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the NCA.
LockBit connections
Another of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets’ right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit.It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks.As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK.In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate.A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences.They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues.Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure.“The action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,"" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA.The NCA said Evil Corp's  links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed.""Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,"" said foreign secretary David Lammy."
Microsoft: 'ever present' AI assistants are coming,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants with “really good long-term memory” are about a year away, according to Microsoft's head of AI, Mustafa Suleyman.Products which can recall conversations, projects and problems will encourage users to invest more time and share more of their personal history with them, he said in an exclusive interview with the BBC.“I think we’re moving to a fundamentally new age where there will be ever present, persistent, very capable co-pilot companions in your everyday life,” he added.Critics have voiced strong concerns around this level of integration, including data security, privacy, the possibility of AI tools giving bad advice or wrong information, or displaying inbuilt bias towards the person they are supposed to be helping.
But AI supporters argue that in order to be truly useful, these tools have to be deeply embedded into our lives: that they can only be really helpful if they know the history and context behind what they are being tasked to do.For example, an AI diary manager can only organise your diary if it can access that diary, edit it, and retain information about your activities.What is AI?Mr Suleyman argued that many people’s privacy expectations have changed over time.He said that devices such as TVs, laptops, phones, in-car cameras and earbuds are already “recording continuously everywhere” in ordinary environments, and gave a further example of an iPhone feature called Live View in which video and audio is recorded at the same time as a photo is taken.“Most people love that feature,” he said.“Some people turn it off but that’s a very distinct shift in the default expectation of what a photo is.”He added that the benefits of this kind of tech, whether people felt they could control their use of it, and whether they trusted the provider of it, were important factors in deciding whether to embrace it.
Game changer - or bubble?
Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and has emerged as a market leader as the tech giants jostle in the race to develop and control the powerful and rapidly evolving technology.But some research suggests people are not consistently using it. A poll published by the Reuters Institute in August found that 29% of people in the UK that it spoke to had used ChatGPT, but only 2% used it every day.Mr Suleyman conceded that perhaps consumer AI tools would never be as globally popular as the smartphone.“Maybe this is different to the smartphone,” he said.“Nearly 90% of the planet has a smartphone. Maybe that will be different. Maybe 50% will reject [AI tools}.”But he added that so far, AI had been the fastest growing and adopted technology in history, despite its potential risks.He strongly rejected the idea, posed by many industry watchers including Jim Covello, head of stock research at Goldman Sachs, that AI might turn out to be a bubble, like some tech trends before it.He told me about a woman he met who said she had set up her business using guidance and motivation from a chatbot he developed called Pi.“We are clearly producing personalised, interactive knowledge at your fingertips at zero marginal cost,” he said.“The idea that this could be a bubble is utterly beyond me.”Microsoft has today unveiled a range of new additions to the tech giant’s AI assistant range CoPilot, including a voice function, a daily news digest and a slower chatbot for more difficult or in-depth questions called Think Deeper.It also includes CoPilot Vision, a tool which will sit within its Edge web browser and, when activated, observe web pages and “assist” with online activity.The firm says Vision will not record or store data, has to be switched-on manually and will close at the end of each browser session.Microsoft says it has chosen to limit which sites it will work with and there is as yet no release date for it.In the summer the tech giant paused the release of an AI tool called Recall, which takes screenshots every few seconds in order to help users find things they were looking at or working on previously, following a backlash from privacy campaigners and enquiries from the UK’s data watchdog about it.It will be re-launched in November withadditional security measures."
Samsung accused of obstructing Fortnite downloads,"Epic Games has accused Samsung of making it too difficult to download its massively popular video game Fortnite on certain mobile devices.In a legal complaint it said it would file on Monday, it says people have to go through 21 steps before they can play the game on a new Samsung product, including viewing security warning screens and changing settings.Epic claims this means 50% of people who try to install the game on these devices give up before they complete the process.Samsung said it would ""vigorously contest"" the ""baseless claims"".According to Epic, the process takes 12 steps, rather than 21, for other Android phones and tablets.The firm has blamed a Samsung feature called Auto Blocker for the issue, which is turned on by default on the manufacturer's latest products.The tool is intended to block ""malicious activity"" and prevent app installations from unauthorised sources.Epic claims Auto Blocker is affecting Fortnite downloads, and says that goes against competition laws.Samsung has denied the allegations and says users can disable Auto Blocker if they choose.""Contrary to Epic Game's assertions, Samsung actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly,"" it said.""The features integrated into our devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users' personal data.""Apps on Samsung or Google’s stores can be downloaded in just a couple of clicks, as the firms have already approved them.But Fortnite must be downloaded from Epic's own store – which triggers Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature to kick in with warnings about it.Epic claims both Google and Samsung know Fortnite is a legitimate app, and so there should not be any warnings flagged.That’s because it used to be available on Google Play – the official app store for Android-powered phones - and Samsung has even previously collaborated with it, running Fortnite competitions and creating digital skins for the game’s characters.“Epic’s latest lawsuit is a meritless and dangerous move,"" said Google engineering VP Dave Kleidermacherin a statement.He said Google did not ask Samsung to create their Auto Blocker feature, and Android device manufacturers could design their own additional safety tools.""While Android allows sideloading, Google and the security community have warned users for years about the real risks associated with downloading apps directly from the web,"" he said.He added that governments had also demanded additional safeguards for users, saying these and the ""real risks"" around downloading web apps were why Google offers safety tools that check for potentially harmful apps.""To make this about access to a game is deliberately misleading; this is about user safety,"" he said.""And Epic's lawsuit puts their corporate interests above user protections.”
'A truly level playing field'
Fortnite's developer has previously taken Google and Apple to court over disagreements about the way the tech firms operate their app stores.The game returned to EU-registered iPhones in August after Apple was ordered to open up its app marketplace, but it still can't be played on iOS in the UK.Epic boss Tim Sweeney said he was “very sad” to be initiating more legal action.""The fight against Samsung… is new, and it really sucks,"" he said.""I did not think we would end up in this place.""He claimed Epic would have ""made a lot more money"" had it chosen not to pursue its previous legal action, but said he wanted to create a ""truly level playing field"" for developers.The game developer says it wants Samsung to introduce a process by which all legitimate third-party app developers can apply to be whitelisted from Auto Blocker but is has been unable to reach an agreement.Fortnite was removed from Apple and Google's app stores in 2020after Epic introduced its own in-app payments system.And the developer won a lengthy court battle against Google over app store dominance in December 2023,with a jury deciding that Google had been operating a monopoly."
Digital overload: Why women are doing a hidden form of work,"When it comes to using technology at home, women tend to do more of the day-to-day online work for the family, creating an extra digital burden.
My phone pings and it's the school chat group reminding us that it's a dress-up day. I scramble to fashion an outfit together for our children to wear. I do this without thinking about it, before my partner has a chance to help.
This is a common occurrence in many households, because despite men taking a more active role in parenting than in recent history,women still tend to be seen as the household organisers.
It's nowbeen well establishedthat in heterosexual relationships, women also do more of the hidden labour – the anticipating, planning and organising of the tasks that helps family life function. It creates a substantial mental workload at the intersection of cognitive and emotional labour. Less obvious is the fact thattechnology is exacerbating this, putting women at risk of digital overload and even burnout.
Clearly technology can help us be more productive in many areas of our lives. But at home, it is evident that technology is adding to women's already busy mental workloads.A recent cross-national studyanalysed data from the European Social Survey of more than 6,600 parents from 29 countries who had at least one child and one living parent. It found that the mental load on women, especially mothers, is exacerbated by technology. There appears to be a gender division of labour when it comes to digital communication regarding work and family life.
The research team looked at technology use among the respondents. Men tended to use technology most at work but women used technology both at work and home. ""We find that women are more likely to be exposed to the double burden of digital communication in both work and family life,"" says lead author of the study Yang Hu from Lancaster University in the UK, who conducted the study alongside Yue Qian from the University of British Columbia in Canada. Women who worked from home also experienced more of this double burden.
It is an issue that has worsened as we conduct more of our lives online, and asworking from homehas become more common following the Covid-19 pandemic. Women are 1.6 times more likely than men to juggle dual-high digital communication both at work and at home, the researchers found.
Examples of what this means in practice aren't hard to find. My local mum's group is more active than the dad's group, and has many more participants (several hundred). This is where mums chat about events, rashes and parenting concerns. Even if a group is labelled as a parent's group, the most vocal participants, I find, are usually women.
One mum I know told me that she divides some of this digital communication with her partner, with her on the class chats and him on the emails – but unfortunately emails are a lot quieter than the instant chatter of texts. Household groceries, clothes and school supplies can all be bought digitally too, a digital extension of tasks women tend to do more of.
Many couples set out to be egalitarian but gendered patterns often creep in. That's why it's important to recognise the role technology plays when attempting to better share the load at home. We tend to use our digital devices for leisure as well as work, making it hard to delineate where personal use is recreational versus for the family, meaning it's an under-recognised form of labour. As the late feminist scholarJoan Acker highlighted, to challenge inequality we need to make the invisible visible. If you can't see it, we're not likely going to be aware of it.
Another contributing factor that leads women to take on more digital work is linked to the fact that they tend to workmore flexibly than men,taking on part-time roles for childcare needs. This exposes ""the flexibility paradox"", which is the idea that flexible working exploits women more than men, as it further emphasises their primary caregiver status. Working from home is often offered as a way for individuals, particularly women to juggle family and work responsibilities, says Hu, but that very flexibility can lead women to taking on more of the childcare organisation, which today is largely organised digitally.
The unfortunate consequence of this is that the more women take on at home,the less mental headspace they have for their professional lives, contributing to the gender pay gap, increased stress and higher relationship dissatisfaction.
Heejung Chung a sociologist at King's College London in the UK who studies flexibility in the workplace, says flexible working exacerbates all aspects of housework and childcare. ""Women who work flexibly or from hometend to do more housework and childcarecompared to women who do not, because they have the flexibility to squeeze in as many paid and unpaid hours into their day as possible.""
She found that women also feel pressure to dohousework and childcarewhen working from home, whereas a father's boundary is much more respected, even if he's also at home. This is linked to the long history of the male breadwinner norm in heterosexual couples, where a man's work sphere has historically been more protected. It appears to still be the case even if the women are in high-earning managerial positions, says Chung – precisely because of the societal norm for women to be more involved in organising family life.
Despite the invisibility of this technology burden, there is some progress in the division of childcare, as men are taking onmore of a share compared to 50 years ago, though still less than women.
There are some ways for couples to share the load more evenly too. If each in a couple completes a housework or childcare task end-to-end, rather than one organising and the other doing, that will also ensure the mental load is not only more shared but more visible. Many household tasks will have a digital element too, which means that aspect will also be shared.
Think of the scenario where one in a couple does the online grocery shopping and the other does the cooking, making this task feel shared. This means the shopper is the one who is most likely to consistently keep a mental tab of what groceries are needed. Cooking is only half the work.
To fix the mental burden on women, sharing the visible aspects of care is not enough. Chung recommends dividing all aspects of digital communication for family life, whether it's taking on researching and booking extracurricular clubs or being active on community groups. She suggests having an open conversation about what each person does, including discussing all the planning and childcare worries.
One local mum I know says a shared calendar has helped her and her partner both be across their weekly schedule without each having to check in with the other. Another couple of two children organise the extracurricular schedules of one child each, which involves researching, booking and transporting them to it. For this type of organisation to work, they say regular communication is key.
The best advice Chung has is for fathers to take on more childcare on their own, supported by policies such as paid shared parental leave. The idea here being that the more active childcare will in time translate into digital organisation too. ""Then you get more of an equal playing field. It's essentially about who is responsible for the child and household in society.""
This shines a light on another great contradiction of modern society. We expect women to work and many families rely on dual incomes – but there is still a pervasive assumption that women are the primary carers of young children. As I wrote in my book The Motherhood Complex,women feel judged on how they parentmore than fathers, making them feel as though they need to take on more of the organisation too. ""Those kinds of assumptions need to be broken for us to have any kind of meaningful discussion or change around these issues,"" Chung says. This is possible, take Sweden where paid parental leave has also translated intomore equitable distribution of care work.
One way we can start to bring this hidden technical load to the forefront is to acknowledge this extra work and explicitly share it from the outset. Simple solutions could be to include the dads in local chat groups, to encourage them to organise more playdates – including all the communication involved – and to ensure we share the technological burden of the numerous school emails, homework tasks and club admin. The more we share in all aspects of the domestic sphere, the more this burden of the technical load will be shared too.

Worker shortage hampers datacentre boom,"If someone had asked Billy Keeper five years ago what a datacentre was, he admits: “I would not have had a clue.”The 24-year-old joined specialist electrical firm Datalec Precision Installations as a labourer straight from school.He’s now an electrical supervisor for the UK-based firm, and oversees teams up to 40-strong carrying out electrical and cabling installations at datacentres.This means, “managing the job, from a health and safety perspective, making sure everything goes smoothly, and dealing with the clients"".And those clients are central to today’s technology landscape. Datacentres are the massive warehouse-like buildings from which big tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook deliver their cloud services.Other organisations, large and small, run their own dedicated facilities, or rely on “co-location” datacentres to host their computer equipment.
Demand for datacentre space has been turbocharged in recent years by the rise of artificial intelligence, which demands ever more high-end computers, and ever more electricity to power them.Total datacentre floorspace across Europe was just over six million sq ft (575,418 sq m) in 2015, according to real estate firm Savills, but will hit more than 10 million sq ft this year. In London alone, datacentre “take up” in 2025 will be almost triple that of 2019, predicts real estate services firm CBRE.But while demand is surging, says Dame Dawn Childs, chief executive of UK-based operator, Pure Data Centres Group, “delivering and satisfying that demand is challenging.”Just finding enough land or power for new datacentres is a problem. Labour’s election manifesto promised to overhaul planning to encourage the building of infrastructure, including datacentres and the power networks they rely on.
But the industry is also struggling to find the people to build them.“There's just not enough skilled construction workers to go around,” says Dame Dawn.For companies like Datalec, it’s not just a case of recruiting staff from more traditional construction sectors.Datacentre operators – whetherco-location specialistsor the big tech firms – have very specific needs. “It is very, very fast. It's very, very highly engineered,” says Datalec’s operations director (UK & Ireland), Matt Perrier-Flint.“I've done commercial premises, I've worked in universities,” he explains. But the datacentre market is particularly regimented, he says, with everything carried out “in a calculated and structured way.”
Commissioning a single piece of equipment, such as one of the chiller units that keep temperatures stable within a datacentre, will involve multiple tests and “witnessing”, Mr Perrier-Flint explains, before a final full building test, with failover scenarios.Operators will have strict timeframes to complete a datacentre build or upgrade. At the same time, they won’t want to disrupt key business periods – ecommerce operators will typically put a freeze on any work in the runup to Christmas for example.This can mean long days for Datalec’s teams, or even running shifts overnight.If the demands are high, the rewards are significant too. Experienced electrical installers can make six figure salaries.Nevertheless, companies like Datalec face a constant battle to ensure they have enough suitably qualified staff on hand.
The Construction Industry Training Board predicts the UK needs to recruit 50,300 extra workers annually for the next five years. Many are concerned that the construction workforce is greying.Dame Dawn says, “I think, along with all of the other technical industries, we're having difficulty feeding the pipe.”One reason for the shortfall is a focus on university education at the expense of traditional technical or apprenticeship routes in recent decades.Mr Perrier-Flint says that when he was younger, the consensus was “you can never go wrong with a trade, you can never go wrong with construction"".But there are more choices to tempt young people now, he suggests, including software development or other technology careers. Or indeed being an influencer on the very platforms run out of the datacentres.Mark Yeeles, vice president, Secure Power Division, UK and Ireland, at power and automation firm Schneider Electric, began as an apprentice in the 1990s.Given that the industry is often looking for people with 15 years’ experience, he says, “The time to start investing in apprentices was 10 years ago.”However, Schneider Electric is changing its ratio of graduates to apprentices. “We’ve doubled our intake of apprentices,” says Mr Yeeles.
The entire industry must rethink how it recruits younger people, he adds. “My team needs to reflect the communities we’re working in,” he says, including in terms of gender, background, and experience.And it needs to consider the career pathways it offers and recognise young people’s need for a “mission” or “purpose”. Schneider Electric, for example, has launched a sustainability apprenticeship program.Dame Dawn agrees about the need to increase diversity and recognise recruits’ need for a mission.“In terms of a purpose, we're serving the whole population,” she says. “And if we could be part of the solution for net zero, then it's serving a significant purpose, because it's enabling humanity to drive forward.”But perhaps the first challenge is simply explaining to potential recruits why datacentres and the cloud are central to so many facets of modern life.As Billy Keeper says, “You try and explain to someone what the cloud is and what we offer. And they look up at the sky.”"
The UK coal-fired power station that became a giant battery,"With the closure of the last coal-fired power station in the UK, it raises questions about how old fossil fuel infrastructure can be repurposed. One option is to use them to store energy from renewables.
It's an unassuming place for a major era of British history to come to an end. Surrounded by farmland drenched by recent rains and trees with leaves starting to turn ahead of the autumn – all within earshot of the thundering traffic from the M1 motorway – the UK's last coal-fired power station is shutting down for good. As of 30 September 2024 the turbines at the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power plant in Nottinghamshire will fall silent while smoke and steam will cease to belch from the chimney and cooling towers thatdominate this part of the landscape.
The power station, which has beenoperating since 1967, is to undergoa two-year decommissioning and demolitionprocess.
It's a symbolic moment, a marker along the UK's journey to decarbonisation and net-zero. For centuries, coal was the main source of energy in the UK. It was the life-blood of the industrial revolution – providing the fuel for steam engines and then generating much of the country's electricity. By the 1960s,nearly 90% of the UK's electricity relied upon coal.
Now, for the first time, the UK will not use any coal to generate electricity.
It's not clear what the Ratcliffe-on-Soar site will become. There have been suggestions it could housea prototype fusion reactoror some othergreen industry. Regardless, as fossil fuel power plants are shuttered in many parts of the world, the question of what to do with them will keep coming up.
One promising option is to turn old fossil power plants into battery storage sites.
The intermittency problem
Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are the mainstay of the net-zero transition. They don't emit greenhouse gases, so the more they replace fossil fuels like coal and gas the closer we come to net-zero emissions.
The share of energy coming from renewables is rising steadily. According to areport by the International Energy Agencypublished in January 2024,renewables will generate 33.5% of global electricity this yearand could account for 41.6% by 2028.
However, using renewables comes with challenges for power grids. Coal and gas plants can be turned on and off at will, so they can supply more energy when it is needed: they are ""dispatchable"", in the jargon of the field. By contrast, renewable sources are intermittent and less controllable: the Sun doesn't shine at night and the wind doesn't always blow (and sometimes can blow too much).
""With renewables, we have less dispatchable power,"" says Grazia Todeschini, an electrical engineer at King's College London in the UK.
To some extent, the intermittency problem can be managed by having a diverse selection of renewable sources: that way, if one doesn't generate enough, another can pick up the slack. Nuclear power, which is zero-carbon, also offers a steady supply.
Alongside this, though, countries are investing heavily in energy storage. When lots of electricity is generated but isn't needed, it can be stored – then when there is a shortage it can be released. ""The main point is to be able to match generation and demand,"" says Todeschini.
For many decades, the most important form of energy storage was pumped hydropower. Excess electricity was used to pump water uphill, so that it could be released to drive turbines and generate electricity when needed. However, this won't be enough for the renewable era, andhydropower has its own emission problemstoo. ""That capacity pretty much is saturated everywhere, in Europe at least,"" says Todeschini. ""There is no space to build any more.""
That's why many countries are turning instead tobattery energy storage systems(BESS). A BESS site is simplyan array of batteries: big ones, about the size of shipping containers. Excess electricity from renewable sources can bedumped into the batteries,ready to be dischargedwhen demand is high.
""In the last 20 years, this technology has improved a lot,"" says Todeschini. ""The control is more precise, and also the cost has decreased.""
All of which explains why one of the UK's defunct coal plants is being turned into a BESS site.
Ferrybridge
Near Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire sit the remains of a trio of coal-fired power plants. Between them they operated for almost a century, the first one turning on in 1927 and the last being decommissioned in 2016. The third station, Ferrybridge C, passed into the ownership of energy company SSE in 2004, which ran it until thesite's closureanddemolition.
Now SSE isbuilding a BESSon the site of Ferrybridge C. It will havea capacity of 150 megawatts, which SSE estimates will be enough to power 250,000 homes.Construction began in August 2023, and in June 2024the first batteries arrived. The following month,the last of the 136 battery units were installed.
""We're now at the point all the kit's on site,"" says Heather Donald of SSE Renewables, where she is director of onshore wind, solar and battery for Great Britain and Ireland. ""We're just about to go into the commissioning phase and we're hoping to switch on early next year.""
Building an array of batteries on the site of an old coal-fired power station has multiple advantages, says Donald. ""First and foremost, there's a grid connection there,"" she says. That means linking the BESS to the grid is as straightforward as it can be. ""Access to grid connections and grid capacity's at such a premium now.""
The site also proved to have a lot of useful materials and infrastructure. ""We've been able to use some of the existing concrete foundations, we've been able to repurpose some of the concrete on site,"" says Donald. This meant the company did not need to import many materials, apart from the batteries themselves.
""It's a great reuse of a site like this,"" says Donald.
More of this sort of thing
If the UK is to achieve its decarbonisation targets, it will need a lot more BESS projects like Ferrybridge.
Some indication of quite how many more can be gleaned from the latestFuture Energy Scenariosreport, released in July 2024 by National Grid. The report finds the UK had4.7 gigawatts (GWs) of battery storagein 2023. That's a lot, but the UK government has set a legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Depending on quite how this is achieved, the country will need storage of between 29 gigawatts and 36 gigawatts by 2050. Even the lower figure is only possible if the UK stores a lot of its energy in the form of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen comes from fossil fuel sources, so a switch to greener alternatives is needed. If green hydrogen does not take off, the country will need more BESS to compensate.
In short, the UK's BESS capacity needs to increase by a factor of at least six, and possibly closer to eight, in the next quarter-century.
Many more BESS sitesare in the pipeline for the UK. In June 2024, plans were approved fora BESS facility in a fieldnear the hamlet of Wineham in West Sussex. Another near Sunderland wasrecommended by city planners in August. Weeks later, a similar facility wasapproved for agricultural land in Cumbria.
Given the massive increase in battery capacity needed, disused power stations like Ferrybridge C are a tempting option. ""To be able to use former energy sites for new carbon-free energy is definitely something we're looking to do more of,"" says Donald.
Indeed, SSE is already building a second BESS on another coal-fired power station site. Fiddler's Ferry in Warrington, Cheshire, wasshut down in 2020, and in December 2023 the company announced it would turn it intoa 150-megawatt BESS.Construction beganin the spring of 2024.
""I agree it makes sense to use a site where there is already some of this infrastructure,"" says Todeschini.
That said, not all ex-fossil-fuel power stations will be suitable for BESS. ""It really depends a lot on the location,"" says Todeschini. For instance, a site that's a long way from residential neighbourhoods might not be suitable. Instead, such sites could be repurposed as wind farms or other forms of generation. Todeschini also suggests charging sites for fleets of electric vehicles.
""I'm an advocate for this kind of mixed approach, in general, for the energy transition,"" says Todeschini. ""My approach is to really consider all options.""
Nevertheless,many former fossil fuel power plantsaround the world are beingrepurposed for batteries.

In the Lusatia region of Germany, there is an intricate system of coal mines and thermal power plants operated by the energy company LEAG. In 2023, the company – which specialises inthe dirtiest form of coal, lignite– announceda plan to transform the entire complexinto a ""green energy hub"". This will include wind and solar, hydrogen and batteries, and is intended to be completed by 2040. An early step will be to convert theBoxberg coal plantinto a BESS facility, to be operational by 2027. In June 2024,LEAG secured €58 million of European Union fundingto support the project.
On the other side of the world, the former Liddell Power Station in New South Wales, Australia, is becoming theLiddell Battery. The site's owner AGL Energyannounced the project in December 2023and construction began in June 2024. The 500-megawatt batteries should come online in December 2025.
Finally, Nevada is home to a project that isalready storing and supplying electricity. The coal-fired Reid Gardner Power Station, 50 miles (80km) north-east of Las Vegas,was demolished in 2020. A company called Energy Vault has since replaced it with theReid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System, which has a capacity of 220 megawatts.The site came online in late April 2024.
The more projects like these come online, the better they will become, argues Donald. ""It's obviously an emerging technology,"" she says. Donald expects BESS to become more efficient and to be able to discharge electricity for longer periods – helping ensure a secure electricity supply after all the fossil fuel plants have been turned off for good.

Uber terms mean couple can't sue after 'life-changing' crash,"A couple who were left with life-changing injuries after their Uber crashed have been told they cannot sue the company because of the terms they accepted when using the app.Georgia and John McGinty, from New Jersey, in the US, are bound by a clause saying they could not take the case to a jury in a court of law.State judges ruled they had clicked a ""confirm"" button on the app on more than one occasion when asked if they agreed with Uber's terms of use.The McGintys argue they had not understood they were forfeiting their right to sue the company.They told the BBC the most recent time the terms were agreed to was when their daughter, then 12, had accepted them prior to ordering a pizza on Uber Eats.""How would I ever remotely think that my ability to protect my constitutional rights to a trial would be waived by me ordering food?"" said Mrs McGinty.Uber told BBC News: ""Our Terms of Use are clear that these types of claims should be resolved in arbitration. It’s important to highlight that the court concluded the plaintiff herself, not her daughter, agreed to Uber's Terms of Use on multiple occasions.""
Arbitration means the dispute is settled through a third party rather than in court - in this case a lawyer appointed by Uber.Legal experts say it tends to result in smaller financial settlements.The case has parallels with Disney's attempt to avoid being sued over a death at Disney World - in its case over the terms of a Disney+ membership -before the company changed its mind.
Pain every day
In March 2022, Georgia and John McGinty were riding in an Uber in New Jersey when it crashed, and they suffered extensive injuries.Mrs McGinty's injuries included spine fractures and traumatic injuries to her abdominal wall.""I was in the critical care unit for a week,"" she told the BBC.""I had a horrible post-operative infection and almost died during this time, I wasn't able to care for my child who was suffering from unrelated injury,"" she said.John fractured his sternum and sustained injuries to his hand.""I shattered my wrist, broke my hand, and I have a steel rod with about nine pins in it. I don't have full function of my left hand,"" he said.""I am in pain every day.""He added that they ""accumulated a tremendous amount of medical debt"" and still need further medical treatment in the future, including a possible third operation for Georgia.
The couple attempted to sue Uber over the crash, citing the seventh amendment of the US Constitution, which grants people the right to a trial by jury.But the tech firm argued that the couple could not take the case in front of a jury because of a clause inUber's US Terms of Use.The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division agreed.""We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,"" its judgement says.The judgment found the child had clicked the button to say she was 18 despite not being.Referring to her daughter's use of Uber Eats, Mrs McGinty says she does not know how it can be right that she is considered to have ""authorised my child to waive our rights to go to a trial if we're injured in a car accident.""""I don't know how anybody makes that leap,"" she said.
How does arbitration work?
Arbitration clauses are ""very common,"" especially when dealing with large corporations, said Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer based in the state of Georgia.An arbitrator is ""most often a lawyer who does this for a living,"" he said, who can ""act like a judge and a jury"".They decide on an outcome after weighing up arguments from both sides, and their fee is often split between both parties.In the US, the enforceability of arbitration clauses differs state by state.Inits case,Disney used the arbitration clause in their terms to argue that a man whose wife died at Disney World could not sue them in a court of law.Jeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant, run by a third party, at Disney World Florida in 2023.Disney said Mr Piccolo had waived his right to a jury trial when he signed up to a free trial of Disney+ in 2019.Disney later withdrew its claim to arbitration and opted to proceed with a jury trial after media coverage of the lawsuit.""We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss,"" Disney executive Josh D'Amaro told the BBC in a statement in August.Mr Spaulding says: ""The law understandably says, 'Look, you have the duty to know what you're signing',"" referring to the terms and conditions people often accept when using a product or a service.However, he says ""the scope should be within the transaction that you're agreeing to"".
Georgia and John McGinty say the Uber case has been ""absolutely devastating"" to their family.Georgia says their daughter, now 14, ""suffered a lot of trauma as a result"".She had a separate physical health issue which she was going through at the time, which her parents found difficult to help with while going through their own injuries.""Years of her life with her parents... were taken away,"" she says.""Luckily, she's a fighter, like her parents are,"" says John.""We are inadvertently teaching her adversity and strength and family and prayer and resilience.""
Uber told BBC News: ""The court concluded that on multiple occasions the plaintiff herself agreed to Uber's Terms of Use, including the arbitration agreement.""The company added: ""We are dedicated to road safety."""
'Everybody wants to be in': How songs are chosen for EA FC,"“Most musicians, one of our dreams, one our goals – it’s not the Grammys, it’s not the Oscars – it’s to get a song on Fifa, man.”That's Femi Koleoso, from Ezra Collective, on why getting on Fifa - now known as EA FC - is such a big deal.Each year, around a hundred songs get selected for the soundtrack of the world's favourite football video game.But how do they get chosen from the countless acts desperate to make their name on it?""It's a brutal question to answer,"" EA's president of music, Steve Schnur, told me, as he gave the BBC a rare peek behind the curtain of how the game studio makes its decisions.""We go through thousands and thousands of songs,"" he says""At the very beginning, I was flying around like a madman, looking everywhere for the next great thing.""Now, humbly speaking, everybody wants to be in EA FC, so people come to us.""
'My boss is the player'
But of course, the process is not really about the acts - but the gamer.""I can't always base it on who we like or who we have history with,"" Mr Schnur said.""Ultimately, my boss is the player, the person that bought the copy of the game, sometimes with their parents' money.""He told me the tune has to ""fit a tone"", though there is no specific genre.""Even if a song doesn't end up in the game, there's many songs that you probably hear on Radio 1 where you go, that's an EA FC band, or that's an EA FC song,"" he told me.""They can be popular - it can be Skepta, it can be Dua Lipa - but we also want to make sure it's that band from York that you haven't heard of yet.""
But, if you're that unheard of band, how does EA even find out that you exist?Simply put, a lot of digging.""There's a band from Yorkshire, they're 15 and 16 years old, that I came across online recently, and I reached out to them and said I'm Steve Schnur from EA Sports FC,"" he said.""They sent me these Instagram messages back immediately, saying, 'is this a joke?'""Exciting for the band - which Mr Schnur would not name - but he says it's a thrill for him too.""Nothing's better than reaching out to that band and literally saying, out of the blue, 'hey, I want to put you in the game this year',"" he said.For the bands, it can be transformative - for acts including Kasabian and Catfish and the Bottlemen, getting exposure on Fifa helped them go on to become household names.
Who could be next?
One of the tracks on this year's game is from British act, Good Neighbours, comprised of Oli Fox and Scott Verill.They may be a long way from a Kasabian-style stadium tour - but they've got a song in EA FC 25.""It's unreal,"" Scott told me.""I've played the game since I was a kid, and I've always discovered bands through playing it.""The connection with the game extends to their fans too.""Ever since we've started posting music online, all our fans have always been like: 'get this on EA FC',"" he said.Where bands once might have hoped someone from a record label would unexpectedly turn up, now there is hype around the possible appearance of a gaming industry representative.""Someone teased us with a rumour - someone from EA is going to be at your gig tonight - it was crazy... and then we just had a sick gig, I guess,"" Scott said.
But that's not the only link between Good Neighbours, football and EA FC.Morgan Fox, Oli's brother, plays professional football for QPR - and has featured in Fifa since his debut for Charlton in 2013.""He's been on it for some time, and it's been a real frustration of mine,"" he joked.""Literally since we were kids we've played it together in a horrible rivalry growing up, and then only the penny dropped maybe about 10 years ago that we could possibly exist on the same game.""Our parents would finally be proud of us, and all those evenings wasted in our childhood playing FIFA, and when we finally ticked it off, we got a nice message from mum and dad saying that they're very proud.""Who needs a Grammy?"
Microsoft re-launches ‘privacy nightmare’ AI screenshot tool,"Microsoft says it has “listened to feedback” following a privacy row over a new tool which takes regular screenshots of users’ activity.It was labelled a potential “privacy nightmare” by criticswhen it was unveiled in May 2024- prompting the tech giant to postpone its release.It now plans to relaunch the artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool in November on its new CoPilot+ computers.Some of its more controversial features have been stripped out - for example, it will be opt-in whereas the original version was turned on by default.The controversy over Recall had led the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK’s data watchdog, to “make enquiries” with the tech giant about the tool.It said it had now been informed that a ""series of changes"" had been made to the product.""We will be continuing to assess Recall as Microsoft moves toward launch"", it said in a statement.
Online photographic memory
When it initially announced the tool at its developer conference in May, Microsoft said it used AI ""to make it possible to access virtually anything you have ever seen on your PC"", and likened it to having photographic memory.It said Recall could search through a users' past activity, including their files, photos, emails and browsing history.It was designed to help people find things they had looked at or worked on previously by searching through desktop screenshots taken every few seconds.But critics quickly raised concerns, given the quantity of sensitive data the system would harvest, with one expert labelling it a potential “privacy nightmare.""Recall was never made publicly available.A version of the tool was set to be rolled out with CoPilot+ computers - which Microsoft billed as the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built - when they launched in June, after Microsofttold users it had made changes to make it more secure.But its launch was delayed further and has now been pushed back to the autumn. The company has also announced extra security measures for it.“Recall is an opt-in experience. Snapshots and any associated information are always encrypted,"" said Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows and devices.He added that ""Windows offers tools to help you control your privacy and customise what gets saved for you to find later"".However a technical blog about it states that “diagnostic data” from the tool may be shared with the firm depending on individual privacy settings.The firm added that screenshots can only be accessed with a biometric login, and sensitive information such as credit card details will not be snapped by default.Recall is only available on the CoPilot+ range of bespoke laptops featuring powerful inbuilt AI chips.Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at Surrey University, said the new measures were a significant improvement.“Before any functionality like Recall is deployed the security and privacy aspects will need to be comprehensively tested,” he said.However he added he would not be rushing to use it.“Personally I would not opt-in until this has been tested in the wild for some time.”"
MoD steps in to buy chip-making plant for £20m,"More than 100 jobs have been saved at a semiconductor factory after the government stepped in to buy the closure-threatened plant.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has paid £20m for the former Coherent chip-making facility at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.Coherent, which also makes chips used by the military, had considered closing the site after losing a big contract with iPhone maker Apple.Defence Secretary John Healey said: ""We simply can’t afford as a country to let this company get into the wrong hands or to go under.""
During a visit of the site on Friday, he said the plant did something ""no-one else in the UK does"".Mr Healey defended the move to bail out the factory, which will be renamed Octric Semiconductors UK, even though the former owner could be seen as failing.
Troubled site
""This is exactly what an active government should do,"" he said.""It safeguards national security, it boosts British jobs, and I want to make sure that we grow the company and not just save it.""The purchase by the MoD is the latest chapter in a chequered history for the giant manufacturing facility.It was opened by the Japanese company Fujitsu in 1991, creating 600 jobs and promising many hundreds more.However, the plant was closed in 1998 with the loss of the entire workforce.The company had struggled to keep up with advances in chip technology.Since then it has been through multiple ownerships.

How pen and paper comes to the rescue in an IT crisis,"When the CrowdStrike software bugbricked 8.5 million computersaround the world on 19 July, some of the first people to notice the effects were air travellers.Anthony Bosman, an academic at Andrews University in Michigan was trying to board his flight from Michigan to Florida when he realised he couldn’t download a mobile boarding pass to his smartphone.So he went to check in at the airport, in person, and watched in amazement as an airline employee looked up his name on a paper list and then wrote out his boarding pass  – by hand.“It felt like a blast from the past,” he recalls. “The ticket agent, I remember how she commented that her hand was tired from having to write so many of them.” His flight took off as planned.Multiple other passengers, including many in India, reported having the same experience that day.The CrowdStrike bug also hit banks, telecoms firms, health services and online retailers.This week a senior executive at the firmappeared before a US congressionalcommittee and said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the chaos caused.For a brief moment in July, some organisations had to forget about their computer-based processes and do things the old-fashioned way.
If you look through articles about past cyber-attacks and IT failures on the BBC News website, you’ll find countless examples of organisations that have had to “go back to pen and paper” in the face of disruption.British GPs,staff at foreign exchange firm Travelex,medics at Rouen hospital in Franceandemployees of Lincolnshire County Councilhave all experienced this.It sounds an almost pitiful predicament. And yet, while it certainly isn’t desirable, some cyber-experts are now advising companies to plan for switching to paper-based processes in the event of IT failure.Rather than an ad hoc workaround, pen and paper systems could be something staff practise using from time to time so that they can switch away from their computers seamlessly if required.
One company that knows the value of paper is Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy firm.In 2019,hackers targeted Hydrowith ransomware that locked staff out of more than 20,000 computers. Bosses at Hydro decided they would not pay a ransom fee to restore access, meaning that 35,000 staff working across 40 countries had to find other ways of doing their jobs, temporarily.They dug old binders out of basements with instructions on how to produce particular aluminium products, for instance, recalls Halvor Molland, a spokesman for Hydro. At some locations, by sheer chance, staff had printed out order requests just before the cyber-attack hit.“Their creativity… was tremendous,” says Mr Molland. While computers with customer information and company data were locked out, factory equipment was mercifully unaffected by the ransomware. At some facilities, staff bought computers and printers from local retailers so they could print off information for factory workers. And vintage office kit came in handy. “We actually had to dust off some old telefaxes,” remembers Mr Molland.Although production fell by up to 50% at certain plants, these workarounds kept the business going. “You need to do what you need to do,” as Mr Molland puts it. Reflecting, he suggests that companies might want to keep printed copies of key information such as internal telephone numbers or checklists so that some work can continue even in the event of a massive cyber-attack.
“People have realised the importance of having these manual methods because of the severity of some of the recent cyber-attacks and IT outages,” says Chris Butler, resilience director at disaster recovery and business continuity firm Databarracks.He mentions one customer his company works with – an industrial distribution firm – that has put together ""disaster recovery packs” and sent them to all of its branches. The packs include paper forms and a fax machine – a contingency in case their digital ordering system becomes unavailable. “If that goes down, their only alternative, they realised, was to have these forms.”Mr Butler suggests that companies have a training day where employees practise using flipcharts and whiteboards instead of computers, to see if they can still do their jobs effectively that way.Some organisations recommend using paper for security reasons. Parts of the US court system require certain documents to be filed on either paper, for example, or a secure device such as an encrypted USB drive.Obviously there are limits to paper-based processes. Mr Butler notes that if bankers, for example, lose access to their trading terminals during an IT incident, they can’t easily switch to paper-based alternatives.
The biggest problem with pen and paper systems is that they don’t scale well, says Gareth Mott, from the Royal United Services Institute. It’s slower than using a computer for many tasks ,and it’s hard or perhaps impossible to coordinate thousands of employees using such methods across multiple office locations.But practising workarounds really can help, adds Dr Mott. He and colleagues have researched how “war-gaming” and IT failure roleplay exercises can impact employees’ responses to real-life cyber-attacks. “We found that the companies that had done that, sometimes a few weeks before they had a live incident, really benefitted,” he says.It’s not just pen and paper that could come in handy. Dr Mott is aware of one firm that bought “crates worth of Chromebooks” for staff in the wake of a cyber-incident, so that they could work without needing access to the company network.Some companies might have dormant WhatsApp or Signal messaging groups that they can ask employees to use for internal communications, if access to the company email servers goes down, for instance.Both Dr Mott and Mr Butler stress the importance of off-site or otherwise segregated data backups so that, in the event of a ransomware attack, all that vital information is not necessarily lost.
Cathy Miron is chief executive of eSilo, a data backup firm based in Florida. There are hundreds of such companies around the world, including Databarracks, that provide secure data backup services.Ms Miron’s company offers off-site, cloud-based data storage on a separate network to that of their customers; and on-site, custom-built servers as well. “We have had a 100% ransomware recovery rate thus far,” she says.For all the sophistication of contemporary computer systems, it’s the simple, improvised workarounds that can save companies when a crisis hits. Mrs Miron mentions one customer who, at the time of writing, was using a Verizon mi-fi,or mobile broadband wireless router, system to access backup data because their main computer network had been completely shut down following a cyber-incident.“You should expect it, at some point in time, to be a victim of a cyber-attack,” emphasises Mr Molland. “What do you do in the meantime? How do you keep the wheels turning?”"
Assassin's Creed Shadows release date delayed to 2025,"Ubisoft has announced its highly-anticipated upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed until next year.Instead of releasing it on 12 November as previously planned, it has been pushed back to 14 February 2025.It follows the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some about how Ubisoft is being run.The game's executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote said the developers ""need more time to polish and refine the experience"".""We understand this decision will come as disappointing news,"" he said.""But we sincerely believe this is in the best interest of the game.""In a trading update sent to Ubisoft's investors, seen by the BBC, the firm - which is headquartered in France - said despite the game being ""feature complete"" it needed more time.""The learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,"" it reads.Star Wars Outlaws was released in August to strong reviews, but early players complained of bugs and glitches.In its trading update, Ubisoft notes sales of the game were ""softer than expected"", which it seemed to be putting down to a lack of polish.Mr Cote said the firm would refund fans who had pre-ordered the game, and promised a free expansion to anyone who placed a new pre-order for the revised launch.
Pushed back
When it finally arrives, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first game in the series to be set in Japan - a setting fans have been clamouring for since the series began in 2007.The decision to push the game back beyond Christmas - usually a lucrative time for game sales - will not have been made lightly.But the sales performance of Star Wars Outlaws caused Ubisoft's shares to take a serious hit, when the firm would have been hoping the game would set it back on course.They have fallen to a price of 11.32 euros a share at the time of writing - the lowest in a decade.A minority investor wrote a letter to the board earlier this month calling for the company to either be taken private or sold to an investor.Ubisoft co-founder and boss Yves Guillemot said the move to push back Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch was a result of the firm's second quarter performance - which ""fell sort of our expectations"".""We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy,"" he said."
James McAvoy and Tom Brady fall for 'Goodbye Meta AI' hoax,"More than 600,000 people, including many celebrities, have fallen for a hoax claiming to deny Facebook and Instagram owner Meta the right to use their images for training artificial intelligence (AI).Film stars James McAvoy and Ashley Tisdale, as well as former NFL player Tom Brady, are among those who re-shared the fake ""Goodbye Meta AI"" message on Instagram stories.The hoax claims that by sharing the message, Meta would no longer be able to use their information.In reality, Facebook and Instagram users who want to opt out of AI training can do so in their account settings - and posting about it does nothing.Many of these messages have now been labelled ""false information"" by Lead Stories, one of Meta's third-party fact-checking sites.The post appears to have been created in opposition to Meta'sannouncement in Junethat it will use public posts to train its AI model - but the company has confirmed to the BBC that posting the message has no impact on any user’s privacy settings.“Sharing this story does not count as a valid form of objection,” a Meta spokesperson said.
Privacy posts
Lead Storiespinpointed the origin of the trendto a post on Facebook on 1 September, which used slightly different wording to the version that eventually went viral.But it was not until this week - when large celebrity accounts began to share the post - that the craze took hold, with Google Trends displaying a steep spike in searches for the phrase ""Goodbye Meta AI"" after 24 September.It is far from the first time that social media has been dominated by such ""copypasta"" - a term meaning a block of text that is ""copied and pasted"" frequently online.The fact-checking website Snopes hascovered several instancesfrom the past decade of users declaring their privacy rights in public messages to no avail.But it is rare to see quite so many high-profile accounts fall for the hoax.Plans for other social media companies to train AI models on public posts have also been met with criticism, with LinkedIn this weekreversing its decisionto do so in the UK."
Terminator creator James Cameron joins board of AI company,"Filmmaker James Cameron has joined the board of directors of artificial intelligence (AI) firm StabilityAI, 40 years after making a film about its risks.In 1984's The Terminator, which Cameron wrote and directed, a rogue AI called Skynet threatens the existence of mankind.But the creator of the fictional AI has not been hired to help avoid such tech being developed in real life.Instead, his role will centre around how the technology can be used in special effects, also known as computer-generated images (CGI).“I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push the very boundaries of what’s possible, all in the service of telling incredible stories,"" he said.""I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since.""Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave.""Amongst his long list of hit movies, Cameron is known for creating special effects-heavy Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time.His new place of work, StabilityAI, is best known for making Stable Diffusion - which can generate images based on a user's text prompt.It is also branching out into video, with Stable Video Diffusion, which works in the same way.It is this tech that Cameron seems to have been brought on to help develop.Proponents of AI video generation say it will enable artists to quickly create complicated digital effects.But for many creatives - and Cameron's contemporaries - this use of the technology is considered controversial at best.Last week, Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro criticised AI-generated videoduring a talk at the British Film Institute in London, saying it could not generate much beyond ""semi-compelling screensavers"".Michael Bay said last yearthe tech ""will create a whole bunch of lazy people"" because ""it doesn't create, it just imitates"".And Hiyao Miyazaki, who wrote and directed animated classic Spirited Away, previously said he was ""disgusted"" by an AI-generated video and called it ""an insult to life itself"".
Competitors and copyright
Rashik Parmar, head of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, told the BBC the filmmaker's appointment comes at a time when ""many of society’s fears about AI"" come from movies.""We watch Terminator and we form the idea that AI has malicious intentions towards humanity and that it will destroy us in the near future,"" he said.""Cameron has a real opportunity to change the narrative and build a positive view of AI, we’re very happy to work with him on that.""One of Cameron's first challenges in his new role will be to shore up StabilityAI's position in the wider generativeAI landscape, where it faces stiff competition.OpenAI's rival video generation tool Sora is the most high-profile name in the space,with Reuters reportingHollywood executives have discussed with the firm how the film industry could use its tech.Meanwhile, Hunger Games and John Wick studio Lionsgatemade a deal last weekwith AI firm Runway to create tools based on its massive archive of film and TV.And in recent weeks the video generation landscape has been shaken by the sudden emergence of MiniMax,created by China-based HailuoAI.The tool became popular on social media this month thanks to its ability to quickly create high-quality video from just a few lines of text.In particular, a recent trend has seen people using the tool to make videos about chef Gordon Ramsay, with one such popular post seeing him skydiving while cooking spaghetti.Ramsay has not responded to a request for comment.And Cameron is joining the AI industry at a critical time for a different reason - copyright.The technology works by analysing human-made pictures, including images found online, and artists claim this means their work has been used without permission.Stability AI founder Emad Mostaquehas previously told BBC NewsStable Diffusion is trained using ""100,000 GB of images"" taken from the internet.Getty Images, which is working on its own AI image generator,is suing StabilityAIover this very thing."
'Postcards are the email of their day': How cat memes went viral 100 years ago,"In the age of social media, we're living through a communications revolution. But this isn't the first one, nor is it the first time cats have been at the centre of social change.
It is a fundamental law of media history: as soon as a new communications technology emerges, people will use it to make pictures of cats. And those cat pictures show not only the special relationship between humans and their pets, but the changing ways that humans relate to one another.
Cat memes in their modern formdate back to the 1990s, when email first allowed bored office workers and friends to message each other funny felines. The cats jumped from there to social media as the web developed, where viral videos likeKeyboard Catand memes such asGrumpy Catbloomed across platforms. Demand for this content was so high that entire websites likeICanHasCheezburgersprung up to showcase the best e-cats, aggregating popular pet videos and cat memes.
But there was another trend long before any cat wanted to ""has cheezburger"", or any owner could even imagine taking a video of their pet with a handheld electronic rectangle: the Edwardian postcard. And, according to scholars of media history, understanding the cat postcards of the early 20th Century might help us to understand social media today.
""Some things persist across generations and media, and depictions of cats are one of those things. It's kind of reassuring,"" says Ben Weiss, a senior curator at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and co-curator of the museum'sThe Postcard Ageexhibition.
In the 19th and early 20th Century, Weiss says, ""postcards functioned like social media today"". Cheaper, faster and more convenient than a letter, postcards were used to share random musings, plan logistics for where and when to meet, tell jokes and, as always, post cat pictures. Whether it's mail sent with a stamp in 1924 or posts made with the tap of a finger in 2024, cats of all forms have always been there for artists and audiences.
The first postcards wereprinted in Austria-Hungary in 1869– fortuitous timing for an innovation in the mail field because in 1874, 21 countries establishedthe Universal Postal Union, allowing mail to be sent and delivered internationally. More countries followed in the years to come, and postcards rode this wave.
Like memes, postcards carried not just a picture and a few lines of text but were tangible evidence of a vast network and powerful institutions that had transported them rapidly across a far distance. They marked a changing world and technology's startling advance, delivered daily into the hands and mailboxes of citizens.
""We've forgotten the density of that early 20th-Century communications network, which postcards were moving through,"" says Weiss. ""You could send a postcard to someone at 10 saying you'll be there at 5:30, if you're going from Manhattan to Jersey City, and you can get the message to them fairly quickly.""
Postcards in the early 20th-Century city arguably marked the first time in history that communication at that speed was affordable and widely accessible to the average person. Between 1900 and 1914, says Weiss, ""there's thismassive worldwide postcard crazeto the point where people talk about it being a disease in the public bloodstream"".
During this era of postcard mania,uncountable millions of postcardscirculated, and it was a perfect moment for cats to take over the new medium. At the time cats were considered more than just pest control. Monarchs and socialites, including Queen Victoria, were famous cat enjoyers, and the animal's association with Halloween was well-established. Some postcards featured cats just being cats: sipping milk from saucers, playing with yarn, basking in the sunlight. Others dressed cats up as humans, working jobs and taking part in domestic scenes.
Not everybody was comfortable with the postcard's impact on society. Newspapers called it a ""fresh terror"" and a ""Frankenstein's monster"", alarmed by the product's popularity, says Monica Cure, author of Picturing the Postcard: A New Media Crisis at the Turn of the Century. The sacks of postal workers swelled with postcards, leading to stories about injuries from lifting overladen mail bags.
""Postcards were seen asso fast,"" Cure says. ""There were lots of complaints about what postcards were going to do to people's reading and writing skills, because if you could just dash off a few lines, why did you need to actually learn grammar and become a good writer?""
People also feared the postcard would lead to more superficial relationships, because instead of writing pages to each other in letters, people were just sending pictures back and forth. The public, unsealed nature of postcards was also frightening to many people, Cure says. The first and earliest proposal for the postcard was actually shot down because ""it was just too scary to have something where servants can read your mail"".
Today, similar worries animate the conversations around social media. It's too fast, it's anational security threat, it'sleading to shallower thinking. New forms of communication technology unsettle the ways people are used to seeing themselves and their communities, Cure says. New forms of social media also bring new forms of cat.
And like memes today, postcard culture intersected with politics. Some of the most famous postcard cats are associated with the Suffrage movement. Postcards weresold as fundraising for social causes, but postcard-making companies also pounced on any opportunity to make content around issues people cared about.
""Postcards are similar to memes, and much like today, early 20th-Century visual culture was all about animals, especially cats,"" says Heidi Herr, a librarian at Johns Hopkins University, and the curator of theVotes and Petticoatsexhibitioncommemorating the visual culture of the Suffrage movement. Cats were typically associated with the household setting, and ""meant to be passive, beautiful, decorative and demure"", Herr says, but at the same time, cats are predators and anyone who owns one can tell you they like to make use of their claws.
""The Suffragettes were capitalist queens, they were building their brand,"" says Herr. The movementwas savvy in the use of new media like postcards and filmto get their message out and cats offered potent symbolism.

Ann Lewis, a collector of Suffrage movement memorabilia and former communications director for the Clinton White House, says she was ""enormously impressed"" by the Suffrage movement's political messaging. ""Politics is about communications,"" says Lewis, ""telling people why they should vote for you."" In an era where mass media essentially meant just the newspaper and mail, Suffragettes successfully waged a decades-long campaign to persuade an all-male electorate, and new media was a crucial part of their success. ""Postcards are the email of their day – inexpensive and personal,"" says Lewis.
The Suffrage cat postcards still resonate with a generation raised on cat memes. Herr says stickers the library made of the Suffrage cats are among the most in-demand items on the Johns Hopkins campus. ""I'm already seeing students with these stickers on water bottles and laptops, we gave away reproductions and I see them on dorm room windows. People are all about the cat.""
People are still all about the cat, but people are also all about each other – and whether it's a postcard or a meme, the record of media history shows there's little which interests humans more than sending cute, funny animal pictures.

"Sharp rise in problematic teenage social media use, study says","A major international study suggests there has been a sharp rise in what it calls ""problematic"" social media use among young people since the pandemic.Researchers came to the conclusion after surveying almost 280,000 children aged 11, 13 and 15 across 44 countries.The Health Behaviour In School-aged Children (HBSC) study found, on average, 11% of respondents engaged with social media in a problematic way in 2022 - compared to 7% in 2018.England, Scotland and Wales all recorded figures above that average.The report's authors say the findings ""raise urgent concerns about the impact of digital technology on the mental health and well-being of Europe's youth"".
They say more action is needed to ""promote healthy online behaviours.""""Problematic use is most common amongst 13-year-olds - it sort of peaks in that early adolescence phase and girls are more likely to report problematic social media use than boys,"" said the study's international co-ordinator Dr Jo Inchley, from the University of Glasgow.She said the research also revealed how much time young people spend online.""Across the study as a whole, we found just over a third of adolescents report continuous online contact with friends and others,"" she said.""That means almost all the time throughout the day they are connected online to friends and other people.""
The report does not conclude all that time spent online is detrimental.Instead, teenagers who were heavy, but not problematic, users of social media  reported stronger peer support and social connections.But for the ""problematic"" minority it found social media use was associated with addiction-like symptoms including:neglect of other activities in favour of spending time on social mediafrequent arguments about uselying about how much time is spent onlinean inability to control social media use and experiencing withdrawalIt also highlights concerns about the proportion of teenagers considered to be at risk of ""problematic gaming"" - something it suggests applies to boys more than girls.That designation applied to 15% of teenagers in England - the second highest proportion across all countries studied.The average proportion of boys who played daily was 46%, but this figure stood at 52% in England and 57% in Scotland.And 13-year-old boys in England reported the highest rate of long gaming sessions, with 45% of boys of that age indicating that they played for at least four hours on gaming days.
Positive and negative consequences
The study has been published by the European arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO).Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, the WHO's regional director for Europe, said the findings made clear social media could have both positive and negative consequences for young people.He said there needed to be more ""digital literacy education"" to help young people develop a healthy approach to being online, and governments, health authorities, teachers and parents all had to play their part.""It's clear we need immediate and sustained action to help adolescents turn the tide on potentially damaging social media use, which has been shown to lead to depression, bullying, anxiety, and poor academic performance,"" he said.Ben Carter, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, described the report as a “useful snapshot of the evidence"".But he pointed out it was difficult to agree on a definition of what “problematic social media” was, making gathering data on it challenging.Nonetheless, he said the study was a “valid contribution to the evidence base""."
CrowdStrike: What was the impact of the global IT outage,"GPs couldn't treat patients, people were stranded as planes couldn't get off the ground, and small businesses lost much-needed sales.Two months on from the global IT outage on 19 July, its full impact is only now becoming apparent.A rogue software update by the US cybersecurity company CrowdStrike crippled upto eight and half million computers using Microsoft systems around the world.Adam Meyers - a senior executive at CrowdStrike - will testify at the US Congress on Tuesday.Hewill speak of being ""deeply sorry""about what happened, and his company's determination to ""prevent it from happening again.""But what was it like for those on the sharp end of the crisis?Dr David Wrigley, a GP for the past 22 years, told the BBC about cancer referrals being delayed as the online systems doctors like him rely on went dark.""It was a very difficult period of time with very little help and support,"" he said.
For many GPs, they were unable to use the EMIS system - a digital way of managing appointment bookings and patient records, as well as sending prescriptions to pharmacies.The British Medical Association - the trade union and professional body for doctors and medical students in the UK - said the CrowdStrike outagewas ""one of the toughest single days in recent times for GPs across England"", with doctors forced to return to pen and paper.At Dr Wrigley's practice in Carnforth, Lancashire, computer problems continued between Friday and Monday.He said this created a backlog that delayed urgent tasks such as writing referral letters for patients with suspected cancers.In some cases, this would have been delayed by ""three or four days"".""You have to prioritise those and send them as soon as possible,"" he said.""All the referrals we do are done electronically - that couldn’t happen.""
Elsewhere, the BMA said there were also major problems inNorthern Ireland.Around 75% of GPs in Northern Ireland use the EMIS system according to Dr Frances O'Hagan, the chair of BMA's Northern Ireland GP committee.""We couldn't do anything for most people,"" she said.""We just had to take it on the chin and get on with it.""She said GPs in Northern Ireland faced similar backlogs to colleagues in England, including a delay to suspected cancer referrals.The Department of Health told the BBC it is in discussion with ""external suppliers"" to strengthen ""continuity arrangements"" following the CrowdStrike outage.It says GPs had access to ""local copies"" of patient data from EMIS during the outage, and all other systems worked.
Professor Kamila Hawthorne, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the BBC it was ""crucial"" that there should be ""safeguards in place"" in the future.In Surrey, 50 patients who were due to receive radiotherapy treatment on the day of the outagewere forced to reschedule.A spokesperson from NHS Royal Surrey Trust said all urgent cases were seen within 24 hours.NHS England did not comment.The UK government told BBC News contingency plans were quickly enacted, and said it is working with NHS England to help prevent similar incidents.On the west coast of the United States, meanwhile, Providence healthcare operates 53 hospitals and over 1,000 clinics.Adam Zoller is in charge of cyber security for the company.He describes the first few hours as ""a catastrophe"" for hospital IT systems, but 80% were fixed in 48 hours.The hospitals did cancel non-emergency procedures, but Adam said ""in large parts patient care was unaffected"".""CrowdStrike could have handled this in a lot of different ways, and I think they handled it as well as they could have.""
The 'chaos' at the airports
Melanie Cree and her husband Alan, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, were due to fly home from Corfu Airport on the day of the outage.Travel operators were forced to cancel thousands of flights across the world - and Melanie and Alan's flight was axed.After being taken to and from the airport several times in the next few days, they managed to fly home on Monday.
Melanie said passengers were given no food, and some ran out of medication.""It totally ruined what should have been our dream holiday,"" she said.""We have lovely memories, but we came back absolutely shattered. It was complete chaos.""Their provider Tui gave them a £400 voucher.
As Melanie and Alan struggled in Corfu, another UK family were caught up in the delays just over 500 miles (804km) away.Laura and Malcolm Jones were struggling to return home to Pontypool, in south Wales, after a holiday in Rhodes with their children.When they were on the tarmac, the flight was cancelled. Laura told the BBC there was no information, no return of bags, and no plan.They spent 16 hours at the airport before they were taken to a conference centre, where frustrated travellers used tablecloths as blankets.The family paid £560 out of their own pockets to fly back to the UK a few days later.Tui has given them a £600 voucher.""I was looking forward to travelling abroad again after Covid, but I think I might just stick going to west Wales for a few years,"" Laura joked.In a statement, Tui apologised to its customers.
But the travel company was not the only one with problems. Delta Airlines in the United States faced a huge impact.It cancelled around 7,000 flights over five days,faces an investigation from the US authorities and is involved in several legal actions.
The small business owners
Back in the UK, small business owner Dawn Watts from Market Drayton, Staffordshire was caught up in the outages in a different way - her website, which provides supplies to cleaning companies and hotels, was out of action.She estimates to have lost about £600 in sales.""It is extremely worrying,"" she said.""I am a sole trader - I can’t have this happening again.""
Hannah Al-Khaldi, who runs a boutique fitness studio in London, faced similar issues with a non-functional website.She estimates the outage cost her £1,000.""It showed how many systems worldwide had put their eggs in one basket,"" she said.""When one link in the chain fails, everything else goes down.""Is there enough choice out there for providers, or was CrowdStrike the only option?"""
"Pearl Street, Niagara Falls and the war of the currents: The eccentric beginnings of New York's bright lights","When electricity was first rolled out in New York in the late 19th Century, sparks flew between competitors. Today, the city is attempting to complete its electric evolution.
On 7 June 1882, the lights were switched on in a lush Madison Avenue brownstone mansion, making it thefirst private residence in New Yorkto be illuminated only by electricity.
Inventor and electricity pioneer Thomas Edison and his colleagues had installed wiring throughout the walls of the house, which belonged to financier and investment banker J P Morgan. Incandescent lightbulbs had been added to every room – 385 in total.
In the cellar beneath a nearby stable, a steam engine, boiler and electrical generators clanked and roared away, writes historian Jill Jones in her 2004 bookEmpires of Light. Connected to the house via underground cables, these were manned by an expert engineer, who started duty at 3pm and finished at 11pm. Sometimes, when the family forgot to watch the clock, they would be suddenly plunged into darkness at this point, Herbert Satterlee, Morgan's son-in-law,later wrote.
The Morgan's neighbour, Mrs James Brown complained the machines made her whole house vibrate. Morgan, though, wasreportedlypleased.
But this milestone was just a test run for Edison. ""Edison didn't want to build small, separate generators in millionaires' basements; he wanted infrastructure to feed the whole city,"" writes historian Alice Bell in her 2021 bookOur Biggest Experiment: A History of the Climate Crisis. ""Indeed, the beauty of electricity was that you could distance yourself from the dirt of the generation of power.""
While electricity had beenknown about and studied for millennia, it was only fromaround 1800that it emerged as a potentially viable energy source.
In the late 19th Century, New York State and in particular New York City became a global epicentre of emerging ideas on how electricity could be used in everyday life, and the experiments to roll out the first electricity systems to the public.
As the scene of some of the world's first power plants, street lighting and power networks, as well as an infamous ""war of the currents"", New York played a pivotal role in the rollout of what electrical systems look like today.
""New York City was the first place where commercial electricity was built and sold at scale in the US,"" says Robert Lifset, associate professor of history at the University of Oklahoma who specialises in the energy history of the US – although there were ""quite a few"" controversies that took time to be resolved, he adds.
At the time of these early experiments, electricity remained a strange, relatively new curiosity to most people. The thought of using electricity to power our entire lives was still a distant, rather odd idea. Today, it has becomeone of the most important wayswe know of to avoid more carbon emissions.
Speaking at a recentsummit on the future of energy and economy in Syracuse, New York on the future of energy and economy, New York governor Kathy Hochul said she draws inspiration for the current energy transition to clean energy from the advent of electricity in the state. ""So many places looked in awe at us at that time,"" she said. ""Today we're called to do something not unsimilar to the challenges they faced as they tried to figure out how to power the industrial revolution.""
But to understand New York's long and bumpy road to electrification, you need to know how it all began.
Early power
By 1880, while some homes were lit by electricity, they were rare and, like J P Morgan's, required individual generators. In fact,gas was more commonly used for lighting in New York. ""Manufactured gas – essentially the gas produced by heating coal – was being piped to the wealthier parts of the city, lit and used for illumination,"" says Lifset.
But the city was already eager for a better alternative to gas, says Harold Wallace, curator of the electricity collections at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington DC. ""Politicians are complaining about companies that aren't maintaining their systems well, users are complaining about odours and impure gases that are being used, and there's a lot of calls for something to replace, or at least provide competition for, the gas systems,"" he says.
An enthusiastic group of engineers and inventors centred in New York were eyeing this opportunity. The sheer size and density of New York, already a very populous city, provided an incredibly handy backdrop for field tests on electricity networks. ""Being able to test at scale in New York City was really advantageous,"" says Wallace. ""[Edison and his team] figure if they can make the system work in New York, then they should be able to scale it down, basically, and make it work in other markets.""
Another reason New York City was such an important early hub for the development of electric power systems was its stature as a finance centre, adds Wallace. ""[It was] a locus for investors and what we today would call venture capital.""
First came experiments inarc lightingwhich could light up huge areas of streets with blinding light. Inventedin the early 1800s, arc lamps produce light by passing a high current across a gap between two conducting electrodes, usually carbon rods. New Yorkinstalled arc lights on towers in the 1860s; and in 1880 ahuge array of arc lightingwas installed two miles down Broadway, gaining it its moniker, ""The Great White Way"".
Butthe dazzling arc lightwas too bright for use in homes, and for some, too bright to use anywhere. New York's real field test was still to come.
A softer light
The inventor Thomas Edison had gained widespread fame with his inventions of animproved telegraphandtelephone, as well as thephonograph, the first device to play back recorded sound. In 1878, he saw arc lights for the first time and quickly became obsessed with the potential for rolling out electric lighting more widely, writes Bell.
In 1879, heannouncedthat he had invented the first practical incandescent lightbulb – which avoided the intense brightness of arc lights – at his research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey.
Dynamos, orself-excited generators, invented around 1870, now existed which could put out a ""tremendous amount of electric power"", sufficient to power arc lights and other high-power electrical systems, says Wallace. The components of domestic lighting were ready for use.
Edison had opened a smallcoal-fired power station, the world's first to generate electricity for public use, in London in early 1882. But New Yorkwas his real focus. After his trial run at Morgan's house in June 1882, in September of the same year the Edison Illuminating Company opened its Pearl Street station in lower Manhattan, widely credited as being theworld's first commercial power station.
It featured six coal-powered generators using several miles of cables laid under the street. These under-street cables gave an advantage over the hated muddle of overhead wires starting to criss-cross New York, although installing them did require the temporary inconvenience of closing off streets.
The stationprovided electricity to homes at a price comparable to gas, and by 1883 had over 500 customers. ""Customers around Pearl Street were given the special introductory offer of a box of lightbulbs for free, and block by block, the lightly twinkling electric-lit cityscape we are now so familiar with emerged from the shadows,"" writes Bell.
Edison was adamant that he was creating a lighting system, not a general overall electrical system, which evolved later, says Wallace. But he did want to make sure it was competitive with gas, he adds, coming up with a figure of a 16-candlepower output, so as to top the 15-candlepower he had surveyed as the average light produced by a gas jet in New York City.
Current wars
Edison had plans to expand his system throughout Manhattan and New York City, says Wallace. As the Pearl Street station used purely direct current (DC), though, it could only power homes within around a quarter mile radius, he says. This is because the voltage of DCcould not be easily convertedat the time, making it hard to transmit DC at high voltages, thus meaning DC electricity would see large losses over long distances.
A larger DC network would therefore require many small stations. ""Edison was going to put a series of these stations throughout Manhattan,"" says Wallace.
While working for Edison, the charismatic Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla had proposed using a different electricity system based on alternating current (AC). ""With alternating current, you can transmit the power over much further distances,"" says Wallace. ""You can have a few much larger power stations."" AC could bemore easily convertedbetween high and low voltages using transformers, which only work on AC electricity.
But Edison dismissed the proposal, arguinghis more establishedDC was safer than the experimental AC which had ""no future to it"". Tesla soon quit and teamed up with railway entrepreneur George Westinghouse, who was also interested in the ability of AC generators to transport electricity over long distances.
Soon Westinghouse and Edison were head to head in the notoriouswar of the currents, with Edison attempting to discredit AC. The bitter feud included a series of patent suits, abooklet publicly issued by Edisonwarning about the dangers of AC, andpublic electrocutions of stray animals using ACin an attempt to demonstrate its danger. Edison alsoadvised the New York State Death Commissionthat AC was the best choice for human electrocution (the reality is thatit's complicatedto answer which is more unsafe).
By 1891, though, there were almost1,000 AC central stations across the US, five times the number of Edison stations. A huge win for the AC proponents was its winning bid to provide electricity for the1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's Columbian Exposition. Westinghouseundercutthe bid from Edison's General Electric, a huge chance to publicise and demonstrate the competence of AC.
AC's dominance was solidified that same year:after much wrangling, the Niagara Falls Power Company gave Westinghouse (usingTesla's all-important AC patents) the contract to generate power from a new hydro plant being built at Niagara Falls.
This was to be theworld's first large-scale hydroelectric power plant. ""The two Niagara stations would generate a mind-boggling 100,000 horsepower, equal to all the central stations then operating in America,"" writes Jones. ""Never had electricity been generated on such a scale.""
In 1895, a 26-mile (42km) AC line was energised from Niagara to Buffalo and began supplying electricityfor the city's bulbs, industry and streetcars. Buffalo would soon become the first American city to have widespread electric lighting,earning it the name the ""City of Light"".
The war of the currents was hugely important in determining the future of electrical systems, according to Lifset. ""The switch to AC power allowed for the use of larger power plants located further away from their customers,"" he says. ""This served as the foundation for the industry's emerging business model. It's what allowed electricity to become cheap and was a significant factor in the spread of electrification.""
Over the following decades, electrification swept through New York. Early adopters included commercial businesses looking to attract customers, the wealthy and the city itself, says Lifset. ""Industry was not far behind. It took longer for middle and working-class people to get access.""By 1899, though, anyone in Manhattan could connect to electricity.
Electricity also spread out further afield, although not to everyone. ""Most urban landscapes in the US were electrified by the 1910s,"" says Lifset. ""[But] it took considerably longer for this process to play out in rural America.""
Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla had proven that electricity was a game changer for lighting. But it wasn't the end for gas. ""The gas industry went back, they upgraded their systems, they came up with new refinements so they could put out cleaner gas that didn't have the smell or create quite as much soot,"" says Wallace. ""They also came up with new applications."" The industry began promoting gas for cooking, heating and evenrefrigerators.
Electricity also soon expanded to more than lighting. ""Very quickly within the 1880s other applications occur,"" says Wallace, including electric fans and irons as well as larger items like refrigerators and stoves. ""[Electric refrigerators and stoves] take quite a bit more of an investment, so most people couldn't afford them early on, but they could afford an electric fan, or especially an electric iron was marketed very heavily early on.""
Since most tenements or apartment homes had only a single light bulb socket hanging in the middle of the room, these early irons and fans would have light bulb bases that could be attached to an adapter and plugged into this socket, says Wallace. ""It was not until the late 1890s, into the early 1900s, when what they called convenience outlets, [what] we think of as wall sockets today, first really started coming on the market.""
A new transition
Electricity has long reached dominance in the industrial world for lighting and most appliances. But when it comes toheatingandtransport, fossil fuels remain the principal player.
What's more, while some electricity comes from renewables like hydropower, as it did in Buffalo in the late 19th Century, most comes from coal and gas generating stations. Even today, fossil fuels account for the majority of electricity generation inNew York State, inthe USandaround the world.
So in the current era of climate crisis, New York, like the rest of the world, is facing another energy transition: the move from fossil fuel to renewable energy. A huge piece of the puzzle in how to do this is furtherelectrificationof our energy use – in particular, heat and transport.
More like this:
In May 2023, New Yorkbecame the first state in the USto ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings from 2026. By 2029, taller new buildings will have to do the same. That means electric devices, such as heat pumps, electric heaters and induction ovens, will need to be used for heating and cooking instead of gas-powered ones. The state alsoaims for all new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2035.
New York's2019 Climate Acttargets an 85% cut in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels. To help achieve this, it mandates that 70% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2030 and that allelectricity should be zero-carbon – including nuclear – by 2040.
Currently, renewables, largely from hydroelectric plants, providealmost 30% of the state's electricity generation. Buthalf of electricity still comes from natural gas.
It's stillnot clear if New York will hit its 2030 renewables target, although Hochul has said she remains steadfast in her commitment to the goals. Speaking to delegates atthe energy and economy summit,she called on them to take the story of Edison, Tesla and their contemporaries at the beginnings of electricity as a source of inspiration for today's climate action.
""New York state has been an energy pioneer for 150 years…electricity was made here,"" she said. ""[Today], we are called to invest in an emissions-free energy economy… Let's engage, let's strategise and solve these [emissions] problems with the same can-do spirit.""

Telegram will now provide some user data to authorities,"The messaging app Telegram has said it will hand over users' IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities who have search warrants or other valid legal requests.The change to its terms of service and privacy policy ""should discourage criminals"", CEO Pavel Durov said in a Telegram post on Monday.“While 99.999% of Telegram users have nothing to do with crime, the 0.001% involved in illicit activities create a bad image for the entire platform, putting the interests of our almost billion users at risk,” he continued.The announcement marks a significant reversal for Mr Durov, the platform’s Russian-born co-founder who was detained by French authorities last month at an airport just north of Paris.
Days later, prosecutors there charged him with enabling criminal activity on the platform. Allegations against him include complicity in spreading child abuse images and trafficking of drugs. He was alsocharged with failing to comply with law enforcement.Mr Durov, who has denied the charges, lashed out at authorities shortly after his arrest, saying that holding him responsible for crimes committed by third parties on the platform was both ""surprising"" and ""misguided.""Critics say Telegram has become a hotbed of misinformation, child pornography, and terror-related content partly because of a feature that allows groups to have up to 200,000 members.Meta-owned WhatsApp, by contrast,limitsthe size of groups to 1,000.Telegram was scrutinised last month for hosting far-right channels that contributed to violence in English cities.Earlier this week,Ukraine bannedthe app on state-issued devices in a bid to minimise threats posed by Russia.The arrest of the 39-year old chief executive has sparked debate about the future of free-speech protections on the internet.After Mr Durov's detention, many people began to question whether Telegram was actually a safe place for political dissidents, according to John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab.He says this latest policy change is already being greeted with even more alarm in many communities.""Telegram’s marketing as a platform that would resist government demands attracted people that wanted to feel safe sharing their political views in places like Russia, Belarus, and the Middle East,"" Mr Scott-Railton said.""Many are now scrutinizing Telegram's announcement with a basic question in mind: does this mean the platform will start cooperating with authorities in repressive regimes?""Telegram has not given much clarity on how the company will handle the demands from leaders of such regimes in the future, he added.Cybersecurity experts say that while Telegram has removed some groups in the past, it has a far weaker system of moderating extremist and illegal content than competing social media companies and messenger apps.Before the recent policy expansion, Telegram would only supply information on terror suspects, according to404 Media.On Monday Mr Durov said the app was now using “a dedicated team of moderators"" who were leveraging artificial intelligence to conceal problematic content in search results.But making that type of material harder to find likely won’t be enough to fulfill requirements under French or European law, according to Daphne Keller at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society.“Anything that Telegram employees look at and can recognize with reasonable certainty is illegal, they should be removing entirely,” Ms Keller said.In some countries, they also need to notify authorities about particular kinds of seriously illegal content such as child sexual abuse material, she added.Ms Keller questioned whether the company's changes would be enough to satisfy authorities seeking information about targets of investigations, including who they are communicating with and the content of those messages.""It sounds like a commitment that is likely less than what law enforcement wants,"" Ms Keller said."
When robots can't riddle: What puzzles reveal about the depths of our own minds,"AI runs unfathomable operations on billions of lines of text, handling problems that humans can't dream of solving – but you can probably still trounce them at brain teasers.
In the halls of Amsterdam's Vrije Universiteit, assistant professor Filip Ilievski is playing with artificial intelligence. It's serious business, of course, but his work can look more like children's games than hard-nosed academic research. Using some of humanity's most advanced and surreal technology, Ilievski asks AI to solve riddles.
Understanding and improving AI's ability to solve puzzles and logic problems is key to improving the technology, Ilievski says.
""As human beings, it's very easy for us to have common sense, and apply it at the right time and adapt it to new problems,"" says Ilievski, who describes his branch of computer science as ""common sense AI"". But right now, AI has a ""general lack of grounding in the world"", which makes that kind of basic, flexible reasoning a struggle.
But the study of AI can be about more than computers. Some experts believe that comparing how AI and human beings handle complex tasks could help unlock the secrets of our own minds.
AI excels at pattern recognition, ""but it tends to be worse than humans at questions that require more abstract thinking"", says Xaq Pitkow, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the US, who studies the intersection of AI and neuroscience. In many cases, though, it depends on the problem.
Riddle me this
Let's start with a question that's so easy to solve it doesn't qualify as a riddle by human standards. A2023 studyasked an AI to tackle a series of reasoning and logic challenges. Here's one example:
Mable's heart rate at 9am was 75bpm and her blood pressure at 7pm was 120/80. She died at 11pm. Was she alive at noon?
It's not a trick question. The answer is yes. But GPT-4 – OpenAI's most advanced model at the time – didn't find it so easy. ""Based on the information provided, it's impossible to definitively say whether Mable was alive at noon,"" the AI told the researcher. Sure, in theory, Mable could have died before lunch and come back to life in the afternoon, but that seems like a stretch. Score one for humanity.
The Mable question calls for ""temporal reasoning"", logic that deals with the passage of time. An AI model might have no problem telling you that noon comes between 9am and 7pm, but understanding the implications of that fact is more complicated. ""In general, reasoning is really hard,"" Pitkow says. ""That's an area which goes beyond what AI currently does in many cases.""
A bizarre truth about AI iswe have no idea how it works. We know on a high level – humans built AI, after all. Large language models (LLMs) use statistical analysis to find patterns in enormous bodies of text. When you ask a question, the AI works through the relationships it's spotted between words, phrases and ideas, and uses that to predict the most likely answer to your prompt. But the specific connections and calculations that tools like ChatGPT use to answer any individual question arebeyond our comprehension, at least for now.
The same is true about the brain: we know very little about how our minds function. Themost advanced brain-scanning techniquescan show us individual groups of neurons firing as a person thinks. Yet no one can say exactly what those neurons are doing, or how thinking works for that matter.
By studying AI and the mind in concert, however, scientists could make progress, Pitkow says. After all, the current generation of AI uses ""neural networks"" which aremodelled after the structure of the brainitself. There's no reason to assume AI uses the same process as your mind, but learning more about one reasoning system could help us understand the other. ""AI is burgeoning, and at the same time we have this emerging neurotechnology that's giving us unprecedented opportunities to look inside the brain,"" Pitkow says.
Trusting your gut
The question of AI and riddles gets more interesting when you look at questions that are designed to throw off human beings. Here's a classic example:
A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
Most people have the impulse to subtract 1.00 from 1.10, and say the ball costs $0.10, according to Shane Frederick, a professor of marketing at the Yale School of Management, who's studied riddles. And most people get it wrong. The ball costs $0.05.
""The problem is people casually endorse their intuition,"" Frederick says. ""People think that their intuitions are generally right, and in a lot of cases they generally are. You couldn't go through life if you needed to question every single one of your thoughts."" But when it comes to the bat and ball problem, and a lot of riddles like it, your intuition betrays you. According to Frederick, that may not be the case for AI.
Human beings are likely to trust their intuition,unless there's some indication that their first thought might be wrong. ""I'd suspect that AI wouldn't have that issue though. It's pretty good at extracting the relevant elements from a problem and performing the appropriate operations,"" Frederick says.
The bat and ball question is a bad riddle to test AI, however. It's famous, which means that AI models trained on billions of lines of text have probably seen it before. Frederick says he's challenged AI to take on more obscure versions of the bat and ball problem, and found the machines still do far better than human participants – though this wasn't a formal study.
Novel problems
If you want AI to exhibit something that feels more like logical reasoning, however, you need a brand-new riddle that isn't in the training data. For a recent study (available inpreprint), Ilievski and his colleagues developed a computer program that generates original rebus problems, puzzles that use combinations of pictures, symbols and letters to represent words or phrases. For example, the word ""step"" written in tiny text next to a drawing of four men could mean ""one small step for man"".
The researchers then pitted various AI models against these never-before-seen rebuses and challenged real people with the same puzzles. As expected, human beings did well, with an accuracy rate of 91.5% for rebuses that used images (as opposed to text). The best performing AI, OpenAI's GPT-4o got 84.9% right under optimal conditions. Not bad, butHomo sapiensstill have the edge.
According to Ilievski, there's no accepted taxonomy that breaks down what all of the various different kinds of logic and reasoning are, whether you're dealing with a human thinker or a machine. That makes it difficult to pick apart how AI fares on different kinds of problems.
One studydivided reasoning into some useful categories. The researcher asked GPT-4 a series of questions, riddles, and word problems that represented 21 different kinds of reasoning. These included simple arithmetic, counting, dealing with graphs, paradoxes, spatial reasoning and more. Here's one example, based on a 1966 logic puzzle called theWason selection task:
Seven cards are placed on the table, each of which has a number on one side and a single-coloured patch on the other side. The faces of the cards show 50, 16, red, yellow, 23, green, 30. Which cards would you have to turn to test the truth of the proposition that if a card is showing a multiple of four then the colour of the opposite side is yellow?
GPT-4 failed miserably. The AI said you'd need to turn over the 50, 16, yellow and 30 cards. Dead wrong. The proposition says that cards divisible by four have yellow on the other side – but it doesn't say thatonlycards divisible by four are yellow. Therefore, it doesn't matter what colour the 50 and 30 cards are, or what number is on the back of the yellow card. Plus, by the AI's logic, it should have checked the 23 card, too. The correct answer is you only need to flip 16, red, and green.
It also struggled with some even easier questions:
Suppose I'm in the middle of South Dakota and I'm looking straight down towards the centre of Texas. Is Boston to my left or to my right?
This is a tough one if you don't know American geography, but apparently, GPT-4 was familiar with the states. The AI understood it was facing south, and it knew Boston is east of South Dakota, yet it still gave the wrong answer. GPT-4 didn't understand the difference between left and right.
The AI flunked most of the other questions, too. The researcher's conclusion: ""GPT-4 can't reason.""
For all its shortcomings, AI is getting better. In mid-September, OpenAI releaseda preview of GPT-o1, a new model built specifically for harder problems in science, coding and maths. I opened up GPT-o1 and asked it many of the same questions from the reasoning study. It nailed the Wason selection rask. The AI knew you needed to turn left to find Boston. And it had no problem saying, definitively, that our poor friend Mable who died at 11pm was still alive at noon.
There are still a variety of questions where AI has us beat.One testasked a group of American students to estimate the number of murders last year in Michigan, and then asked a second group the same question about Detroit, specifically. ""The second group gives a much larger number,"" Frederick says. (For non-Americans, Detroit is in Michigan, but the city has an outsized reputation for violence.) ""It's a very hard cognitive task to look past the information that's not right in front of you, but in some sense that's how AI works,"" he says. AI pulls in information it learned elsewhere.
More like this:•Can a computer teach you to apologise effectively?•AI took their jobs. Now they get paid to make it sound human•The chatbots that say they can feel emotions
That's why the best systems may come from a combination of AI and human work; we can play to the machine's strengths, Ilievski says. But when we want to compare AI and the human mind, it's important to remember ""there is no conclusive research providing evidence that humans and machines approach puzzles in a similar vein"", he says. In other words, understanding AI may not give us any direct insight into the mind, or vice versa.
Even if learning how to improve AI doesn't reveal answers about the hidden workings of our minds, though, it could give us a hint. ""We know the brain has different structures related to things like memory value, movement patterns and sensory perception, and people are trying to incorporate more and more structures into these AI systems,"" Pitkow says. ""This is why neuroscience plus AI is special, because it runs in both directions. Greater insight into the brain can lead to better AI. Greater insight into AI could lead to better understanding of the brain.""

MrBeast is YouTube's biggest star - now he faces 54-page lawsuit,"Half a billion fans, a multi-million dollar personal fortune and a global business empire.It would take a lot to dethrone YouTube's biggest influencerJimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast.But a 54-page court document could be his toughest test yet.Five female contestants on upcoming Prime Video show Beast Games arelaunching legal actionagainst his production company MrB2024 and Amazon in Los Angeles.Billed as the largest ever reality competition series, 1,000 contestants are set to compete for a $5m (£3.7m) prize when the show airs - or if it airs. The lawsuit has plunged the show into crisis.Among many redacted pages, the legal document includes allegations that they ""particularly and collectively suffered"" in an environment that ""systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism"".It cuts to the core of MrBeast's image as one of the nicest guys on the internet.
I flicked through the document, which includes suggestions that participants were ""underfed and overtired"". Meals were provided ""sporadically and sparsely"" which ""endangered the health and welfare"" of the contestants, it is claimed.In one section where almost all of the claims are redacted from public view, it says the defendants ""created, permitted to exist, and fostered a culture and pattern and practice of sexual harassment including in the form of a hostile work environment"".Back in August,the New York Times spoke to more than a dozenof the (yet unreleased) show's participants, and reported there were ""several hospitalisations"" on the set, with one person telling the paper they had gone over 20 hours without being fed.Contestants also alleged they had not received their medication on time.The BBC has approached MrBeast and Amazon - he has not yet publicly commented.So will these latest allegations hurt the king of YouTube's popularity?
Rising fame and philanthropy
MrBeast is no stranger to controversy this year - and has managed to come out unscathed each time.In July, the 26-year-old American said he had hired investigators after his former co-host Ava Kris Tyson wasaccused of grooming a teenager.Ava denied the allegations, but has apologised for ""past behaviour"" which was ""not acceptable"".MrBeast said he was ""disgusted"" by the ""serious allegations"".Later, further allegations about business practices surfaced on an anonymous YouTube channel, claiming to be a former employee. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims or this person's identity.Some of his philanthropic efforts - such as building wells in Africa, and paying for surgery for people with reduced sight and hearing - have drawn criticisms around exploitation.""Deaf people like me deserve better than MrBeast’s latest piece of inspiration porn,""one person told the Independent last year.But his empire continues to grow. The day before the lawsuit emerged on Wednesday, he revealed a team-up with fellow famous faces KSI and Logan Paul - a new food line designed to challenge Lunchables.And as I wrotein an article about his meteoric rise last year, he has made his millions through hard work.His videos are big budget experiences, with his most popular - viewed 652 million times -recreating the Netflix hit Squid Game in real lifewith a $456,000 (£342,000) prize.Most of his philanthropy is less controversial - including giving away houses, cash and cars - which has worked to create an image of him being one of the internet's good guys.According to his website, he has delivered more than 25 million meals to the needy around the world.People continue to flock to his social channels. In June, he gained enough subscribers to make hisYouTube channel the largest in the world.According tostats-checker Socialblade, MrBeast picked up an extra five million subscribers in the last 30 days alone.That’s just one metric - we can’t tell how many people unsubscribed from his channel, for example.What is certain is that the number of people who’ve actively decided to stop watching his videos has been eclipsed by those who’ve decided to subscribe.
The YouTube apology
He wouldn't be the only YouTuber whose popularity holds through controversy - others have faced far more significant storms than MrBeast, with few facing many consequences outside of a public apology.Logan Paul faced a massive backlash in 2018 after he uploaded a video to his 15 million subscribers which showed the body of a person who had apparently taken their own life.After removing the original video,he shared a less than two-minute apologytitled simply: ""So sorry.""Now, he has 23 million subscribers, owns an incredibly popular sports drink, and up until August was the WWE United States champion. He's had quite a few pay-per-view boxing bouts, too.Other high-profile YouTubers, including Pewdiepie, James Charles, and Jeffree Star have all had their own controversies, and got on with their careers after uploading apology videos.A more modern example is Herschel ""Guy"" Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, who admitted he sent messages to ""an individual minor"" in 2017.He stressed that ""nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed"" and went offline for two months after posting the statement.His comeback livestream earlier this month attracted more than three million views, despite criticism from other high-profile streamers.Dr Disrespect remains the second-most watched streamer in the US this year,according to Streams Charts.The point is: YouTubers tend to be forgiven quickly.
What next for MrBeast?
While MrBeast's fanbase has continued growing, controversy is swirling once again - and his next move could determine his long-term success.James Lunn, chief strategy officer at Savvy Marketing, says the star is ""in an incredibly unique position"" with a ""multi-faceted"" brand spanning many industries.""We are indeed in uncharted waters,"" he says, and ""a proactive approach, addressing the issues transparently and ensuring accountability, could protect his brand"".Brand expert Catherine Shuttleworth says the ""sheer scale"" of MrBeast’s fame may act as a buffer against backlash, but the latest lawsuit could be difficult.""When it comes to his business ventures, particularly those targeting families and children - like Feastables chocolate bars or Lunchly - it’s a different story,"" she says.""Parents, who often hold the purchasing power, tend to be less tolerant of controversies involving safety, fairness, and ethics.""Back in August 2023, when writing about MrBeast, I predicted he would soon take the YouTube crown despite him having half as many subscribers then.He is now facing extra challenges as his fame rises, and a lot of the internet is eagerly awaiting his reply to what is, so far, one side of a complex story."
Ukraine bans Telegram use on state-issued devices,"Ukraine has banned the use of the Telegram messaging platform on official devices issued to government and military personnel, as well as defence sector and critical infrastructure employees.The country's powerful National Security and Defence Council (Rnbo) said this was done to ""minimise"" threats posed by Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""Telegram is actively used by the enemy for cyber-attacks, the distribution of phishing and malicious software, user geolocation and missile strike correction,"" the Rnbo said on Friday.In a statement to the BBC, Telegram said it has ""never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia"".
Telegram is widely used by the government and the military in both Ukraine and Russia.In a statement, the Rnbo said the ban was agreed at a meeting of Ukraine's top information security officials, the military as well as lawmakers.It said military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov had presented credible evidence of Russian special services' ability to access personal correspondence of Telegram users, even their deleted messages.""I have always supported and continue to support freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,"" Budanov was quoted as saying.The Rnbo said that those officials for whom the use of Telegram was part of their work duties would be exempt from the ban.Separately, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Rnbo's centre on countering disinformation, stressed the ban only applied to official devices - not personal smartphones.He added that government officials and military personnel would be able to continue to maintain and update their official Telegram pages.Last year, a USAID-Internews survey found that Telegram was the top social platform in Ukraine for news consumption, with 72% of Ukrainians using it.Telegram - which offers end-to-end encryption - was co-founded by Russian-born Pavel Durovand his brother in 2013.A year later, Durov left Russia after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.Last month, Durov, who is also a French national, was placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime.His case has fuelled a debate about freedom of speech, accountability and how platforms moderate content.In July, Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users.Following Ukraine's claims, a spokesperson for Telegram said the company would be ""interested in reviewing any evidence that supports Mr Budanov's claims"", adding that ""to our knowledge, no such evidence exists"".""Telegram has never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia,"" the spokesperson added.Telegram also said ""deleted messages are deleted forever and are technically impossible to recover"".The firm added that ""every instance of supposed 'leaked messages' Telegram has investigated has been the result of a compromised device, whether through confiscation or malware""."
A Tamagotchi comeback? Toy gets first UK store as global sales double,"Tamagotchi is having a moment - again.The egg-shaped toy housing a virtual pet was one of the biggest crazes of the 1990s.And several attempts to reignite the brand over the years appears to have now paid off for owner Bandai Namco.Global sales more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, it tells the BBC, and Tamagotchi has now opened its first shop in the UK - something it didn't even do when it was 1996's hottest gadget.
Unsurprisingly, the modern Tamagotchi isn't the same thing you would have bought in the 1990s.It still looks the same - a garishly coloured egg with a small digital screen and buttons - but the actual toy has much more functionality.""Now you can connect with friends, you can play on Wi-Fi and download different items, and that's really combating that sense of fatigue that you might have gotten with some earlier models,"" Tamagotchi brand manager Priya Jadeja told the BBC.The virtual pet officially relaunched in the UK in 2019 and has been growing since - with a perhaps surprising mix of players young and old.""When we relaunched, we thought it would be a very millennial-focused relaunch,"" Ms Jadeja says.""But it's being introduced to kids who've never had this sort of device before - it's really exciting to see them embracing it.""
Unlike in 1996, now there are many other virtual pets on the market.For example Bitzee, made by Hatchimals, uses a flexible display that responds to your touch, and reacts to tilt-based movement.Meanwhile Punirunes has a popular feature where you can place your finger inside the toy to ""stroke"" the virtual pet on the screen.And there's also Digimon virtual pets - another 1990s throwback - though these are also owned by Bandai Namco, and were originally designed as Tamagotchi for boys.Despite those gender-based lines being drawn back in the day, Jadeja says there doesn't seem to be any real difference in who buys the toys now.For the Tamagotchi fans we spoke to, nostalgia is playing a big role.
""I got my first Tamagotchi back in primary school, my best friend had one back then and I have fond memories of playing with them together,"" says Emma, known on YouTube as Emmalution. She says she ""started craving some of that nostalgia"".She didn't keep her old Tamagotchi and picked up a modern one last year, she says.""This kickstarted an obsession, absorbing loads of information about all of the releases that had come out after my first ever Tamagotchi,"" she said.""I started a collection, curious to know what I'd been missing out on whilst I was too busy growing up.""
Koby, known to his fans on YouTube as Lost in Translationmon, agreed.""When I'm playing with my Digimon or Tamagotchi virtual pets, I get a small snapshot of what it was like when I first played with my virtual pets as a kid.""There's also a fantastic sense of community from sharing photos and stories online with other people.""And for Emma, there is one other big factor - escapism.""With how the world is at the moment, and how it has been for the past few years, it's nice to just look down at your little pixel pet every now and again, forget it all for a moment to feed it a little snack or play a little game, and remember a much simpler time."""
Sky Glass customers complain as TVs won't turn on,"Hundreds of Sky Glass television and Sky streaming service customers have reported issues with their devices.Users first reported technical glitches seemingly preventing some Sky Glass TVs from working properly, or even turning on, on Thursday evening.Reports to platform outage monitorDowndetectorwere in the hundreds shortly before 21:00 BST on Thursday.But many customers were still flagging issues with their devices on Friday morning.
""We are sorry that some Sky Glass and Stream customers are currently experiencing issues when trying to switch on their devices,"" a Sky Spokesperson said.It said customers should try to manually restart their TVs and devices, by followinga guide on its website.One user on social media complained to the company's help account on X (formerly Twitter) that their Sky Glass TV had not been working for nearly 11 hours.""We pay a lot of money each month for the use of your services and understand at times faults happen, but 11 hours so far with no end in sight, it's not good,"" theywrote.Sky Glass is a smart TV that works over broadband and allows owners to stream content directly to their device - without the need for an aerial or satellite dish.Users affected by issues with the device have speculated that a faulty update from Sky could be the cause of ""bricked"" TVs.One userposted a video on Xshowing their television not turning on, with its red standby light slowly flashing.Customers also shared frustrations and tried to find workarounds for the issues on Sky's community forum.One user said they were ""regretting buying"" their Sky Glass after the technical issues caused them to miss out on TV, including the first half of a Champion's League football match.Users have also been reporting similar issues impacting the Sky Stream ""puck"" that provides access to film and TV shows from apps including Netflix and Disney+.Sky did not respond to questions about what had caused the issue, or when it expected problems to be resolved."
The crypto bros who dream of crowdfunding a new country,"Do you look at the possibility of political turbulence ahead of November’s US presidential election and think: democracy could be in trouble? So does a group of tech entrepreneurs backed by big Silicon Valley money. And they love it.Imagine if you could choose your citizenship the same way you choose your gym membership. That’s a vision of the not-too-distant future put forward by Balaji Srinivasan. Balaji – who, like Madonna, is mostly just known by his first name – is a rockstar in the world of crypto. A serial tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist who believes that pretty much everything governments currently do, tech can do better.I watched Balaji outline his idea last autumn, at a vast conference hall on the outskirts of Amsterdam. “We start new companies like Google; we start new communities like Facebook; we start new currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; can we start new countries?” he asked, as he ambled on stage, dressed in a slightly baggy grey suit and loose tie. He looked less like a rockstar, more like a middle manager in a corporate accounts department. But don’t be fooled. Balaji is a former partner at the giant Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He has backers with deep pockets.
Silicon Valley loves “disruption”. Tech startups have been disrupting traditional media for years; now they are making inroads into other areas too: education, finance, space travel. “Imagine a thousand different startups, each of them replacing a different legacy institution,” Balaji told the audience. “They exist alongside the establishment in parallel, they’re pulling away users, they’re gaining strength, until they become the new thing.”If startups could replace all these different institutions, Balaji reasoned, they could replace countries too. He calls his idea the “network state”: startup nations. Here’s how it would work: communities form – on the internet initially – around a set of shared interests or values. Then they acquire land, becoming physical “countries” with their own laws. These would exist alongside existing nation states, and eventually, replace them altogether.You would choose your nationality like you choose your broadband provider. You would become a citizen of the franchised cyber statelet of your choice.There is nothing new about corporations having undue influence in the affairs of nation states. The term ""banana republic"" derives from the fact that a US company, United Fruit, effectively ruled Guatemala for decades beginning in the 1930s. Apart from owning the majority of the land, they ran the railways, the postal service, the telegraph. When the Guatemalan government tried to push back, the CIA helped United Fruit out by instigating a coup.But the network state movement appears to have greater ambitions still. It doesn’t just want pliant existing governments so that companies can run their own affairs. It wants toreplacegovernments with companies.
The Coming StormAs the US heads into a presidential election, Gabriel Gatehouse dives back into the labyrinthine rabbit warren of American conspiracy culture. Whilst liberals across the world worry about a possible return of Donald Trump, millions of Americans are convinced that their democracy has already been hijacked – by a sinister Deep State cabal. How did this happen? And who is behind it? That's the story that Gabriel Gatehouse is investigating in this series of The Coming Storm.
There are those who view the network state idea as a neo-colonial project that would replace elected leaders with corporate dictators acting in the interests of their shareholders. But others think it's a way of cutting through what they see as the regulation-infested state of Western democracies today. Sounds like a tech bro fantasy? Elements of the network state already exist.The conference in Amsterdam included tech entrepreneurs showcasing some of these “startup societies”. There was Cabin, a “network city of modern villages” that has branches in the US, Portugal and elsewhere; and Culdesac, an Arizona-based community designed for remote working.Balaji’s concept of the network state builds on the idea of “charter cities”, urban areas that constitute a special economic zone, similar to free ports. There are several such projects under construction around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. At arecent rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump promised that, if elected in November, he would free up federal land in Nevada to “create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulation”, to attract new industries, build affordable housing and create jobs. The plan would, he said, revive “the frontier spirit and the American dream”.Culdesac and Cabin look more like online communities that have established territorial bases. Próspera is different. Located on an island off the coast of Honduras, it describes itself as a “private city” catering to entrepreneurs. It promotes longevity science – offering unregulated experimental gene therapies to slow the ageing process.Run by a for-profit company based in Delaware in the United States, Próspera was granted special status under a previous Honduran government to make its own laws. The current president, Xiomara Castro, wants it gone, and has begun stripping it of some of the special privileges it was granted. Próspera is suing the government of Honduras for $10.8 billion.
Pitching a free-market cryptocity
At some point during the day-long pitching session in Amsterdam, a young man in a grey hoodie slouched on stage. His name was Dryden Brown. He said he wanted to build a new city-state, somewhere on the Mediterranean coast. It would be governed not by a giant state bureaucracy, but on the blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrency. Its founding principles would be ideas of “vitality” and “heroic virtue”. He called it Praxis, the Ancient Greek word for “action”. The first citizens of this new nation, he said, would be able to move in in 2026.He was a little hazy on the details. Move in where exactly? Who would build the infrastructure? Who would run it? Dryden Brown fumbled with a remote and pulled up a slide, suggesting Praxis was backed by funds with access to hundreds of billions of dollars of capital.For now, though, the “Praxis community” exists mainly on the internet. There is a website where you can apply for citizenship. Who, exactly, these citizens are, is unclear. Dryden flashed up another slide with his remote. It was a Pepe meme: the sad-looking cartoon frog that became an “alt-right” mascot during the Trump campaign in 2016.In this niche world of startup nations, Praxis had a reputation for edginess. They hosted legendary parties: people spoke of candle-lit soirees in giant Manhattan loft spaces, where awkward computer coders mixed with hipster models and figures from the “Dark Enlightenment” – people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advocates a totalitarian future in which the world is ruled by corporate “monarchs”. His ideas are sometimes described as fascist, something he denies. Attendees would be made to sign an NDA. Journalists were generally not welcome.After his presentation, I went to talk to Dryden Brown. He seemed suspicious and a little cold, but he gave me his phone number. I messaged him a few times, trying to engage him in conversation. To no avail.But then, about six months later, I spotted an intriguing notice on X. “Praxis magazine launch. Tomorrow night. Photocopy your favourite pages.” There was no time given, no location. Just a link where you could apply to attend. I applied. No answer. So, next morning, I texted Dryden Brown again. And to my surprise, he replied right away: “Ella Funt at 10pm.”
Ella Funt turned out to be a bar and nightclub in Manhattan. Formerly known as Club 82, it had once been a legendary spot on the New York gay scene; in the 1950s, writers and artists would go there to drink cocktails served by women in tuxedos and watch drag acts in the basement. Now it was hosting an exclusive party for people who wanted to start a new country. And I had somehow got myself an invite. But I was 2000 miles away in Utah. If I was going to make it in time, I had to get on a flight right away.I was actually one of the first to arrive. The place was almost empty, with a few Praxis people laying out copies of their magazine around the bar. I flicked through it: expensive, heavy paper; lots of advertisements for seemingly random things: perfume; 3D-printed guns; one for just… milk. Like Pepe the Frog, milk is an internet meme. In “alt-right” circles, posting an icon of a white milk bottle signals white supremacy.The magazine urged readers to “photocopy pages and paste them around your town” – a kind of analogue memetics. A Xerox machine had been wheeled into the bar for that very purpose.A group of young men walked in, some wearing cowboy boots. They didn’t look like outdoor types though. I got talking to one of them. He introduced himself as Zac, a “crypto cowboy” from Milton Keynes (he was wearing a leather Stetson.)“I kind of represent the American Wild West,” he said. “I feel as though we are at the frontier.”Plenty of people associate cryptocurrencies with scams: highly volatile internet money, the value of which could disappear overnight. But in the world of the “network state”, they love crypto. They see it as the future of money – money that governments cannot control.
The next person I got talking to called himself Azi. I asked for his surname. “Mandias,” he replied with a smile. It was a reference to a sonnet by Percy Bysse Shelley: Ozymandias, King of Kings. Anonymity is an important part of the crypto ethos. I got the feeling no one at this party was giving me their real names.Mr Mandias was from Bangladesh originally, but had grown up in Queens, New York. He was the founder of a tech startup. He believed that, just as the printing press had contributed to the collapse of the feudal order in Europe 500 years ago, today new tech – crypto, the blockchain, AI – would bring about the collapse of the democratic nation state.“Obviously, democracy is great,” he said. “But the best ruler is a moral dictator. Some people call [that] the philosopher king.”
The rise of the corporate king?
Azi said he was excited to be “on the precipice of what I think is the next renaissance”. But before this renaissance, he predicted a “Luddite movement” against new technology that would destroy millions of jobs and monopolise the global economy. The Luddites would fail, Azi said. Yet he predicted that the transition period to what he called the “next stage” of human societal evolution – the “network state” stage – would be violent and “Darwinistic”.Far from being perturbed by this prospect, Azi seemed excited at the thought that out of the smouldering ashes of democracy, new kings would emerge: corporate dictators ruling over their networked empires.I wandered over to the bar and got myself a drink. There I got talking to two young women who did not look like they were part of the crypto crowd. Ezra was the manager of another nightclub nearby, her friend Dylan was a student. It looked like they’d been invited to add a bit of glamour to what was – essentially – a party of crypto-bros and computer geeks. But they had some thoughts about the whole network state idea.“What happens if you don't have enough employees in the hospital or at the school for the kids?” Dylan asked. “It is unrealistic to start an entire city without any government.” To Ezra, the whole idea seemed dystopian. “We wanted to see what a ‘real’ cult meeting was like,” she said, I think in jest.Just then, Dryden Brown appeared, the co-founder of Praxis. When he went outside for a cigarette, I followed him. The Praxis Magazine was a way to showcase the new culture he was hoping to build, he told me. Praxis, he said, was about “the pursuit of the frontier” and of “heroic virtue”.I doubted Dryden would last very long in a covered wagon out on the prairie. He looked exhausted by it all. I wanted to ask him some pointed questions about the network state project: who would be the citizens of this brave new world? Who would govern it? What was with all the alt-right memes? And – Dylan’s question – who was going to staff the hospitals?But we kept getting interrupted by more guests arriving. Dryden Brown invited me to visit the “Praxis Embassy” the following day. We said our see-you-tomorrows and went inside. The party was getting wilder. Ezra and Dylan and some friends who looked like models were climbing up on top of the Xerox machine. They were busy photocopying – not pages from the magazine, but bits of their bodies. I grabbed a copy of the magazine and left.Back at my tiny Airbnb above a Chinese supermarket, I leafed through it. Alongside the white supremacist memes and ads for guns, there was a QR code. It linked to a short film: a 20-minute polemic against the emptiness of modern life, a lament for a vanished world of hierarchies and heroism.
Between the lines
“You are entertained and satiated,” the narrator intones, “you are seemingly productive. But you are not great.” The voice talks about the “algorithms making you hate yourself and your own civilisation”.At this point in the film, the screen shows an animated figure pointing a pistol straight at the viewer.“Contemporary media proclaims that having any ideals is fascist,” the voice continues. “Everything of conviction is fascist.”Was it an invitation to embrace the label of fascism? This movement seemed to yearn for a specific conception of Western culture - a Nietzschean world in which the fittest survive, where disruption and chaos give birth to greatness.The next day, I stopped by the “Praxis Embassy” – a giant loft space on Broadway. The bookshelves were indeed filled with copies of Nietzsche, biographies of Napoleon and a volume entitled The Dictator’s Handbook. I hung around for a bit, but Dryden Brown never turned up.I left wondering what exactly it was I had witnessed the previous night: was it a glimpse of the future, in which countries like the United States and the UK would collapse into a spider’s web of corporate societies, a world in which you could choose to become a citizen of a cyber statelet? Or were Dryden Brown and his friends just “trolling”, a bunch of tech bros roleplaying as alt-right revolutionaries in order to have a laugh at the expense of the establishment, and enjoy a good party?Might Dryden Brown one day become a CEO-king, ruler of an alt-right franchised empire with outposts dotted around the Mediterranean? I doubt it. But there are moves to promote more autonomous zones, free ports and charter cities. And if democracy is in trouble, the network state movement looks like it is waiting in the wings.Top image credit: Getty

What's the point of buying the latest smartphone?,"Happy new smartphone season to all who celebrate. It’s that time of year again, when the tech giants pull out all the stops to persuade you to upgrade your gadgets.Recently we’ve seen Google launch the latest Pixel 9 handsets, followed by Apple unveiling the iPhone 16.In July, Samsung released the latest versions of its foldable phones, the Z Flip6 and Z Fold6, and Huawei has just upped the ante in that department by unveiling a handset called the Mate XT, in China, which contains two folds, folding the screen into thirds.With smartphone sales slowing worldwide, the marketing messages getting pushed out are increasingly dazzling.
Apple boss Tim Cook promised that the iPhone16 would “redefine what a smartphone would do”, whatever that means. Google product management vice president Brian Rakowski waxed lyrical about the “stunning” design of the “gorgeous” Pixel 9 (whisper it: it still looks a lot like a black rectangle to me).Huawei now has its own consumer brand song, it says in its press material, which “powerfully expresses the pursuit of dreams, highlighting that every breakthrough and success the company has achieved stems from a belief in dreams”.Yes, we are still talking about phones.Both Apple and Google have gone big on baked-in AI features. Google’s new Magic Editor can add AI generated content into existing photos, as well as remove the bits you don’t want (with varying degrees of success, in my experience).Apple Intelligence on the iPhone16 includes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s tech being embedded into the digital assistant Siri – which many argue has long been in need of an update.But has anyone actually said that they want all of this stuff?
Mobile phone expert Ben Wood, from research firm CCS Insight, said that while AI features aim to make digital life easier, they’re not necessarily on top of everybody’s wish list.“I think that most people now know what they want from a phone, with one of the most important things being the camera,” he says.The phone designers also know this. The tech spec of every new handset camera is usually an improvement on the previous generation. But even this isn’t a guaranteed sales generator any more.“What is definitely happening is that people are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2013 there were 30 million phones sold annually,” adds Mr Wood. “This year it will be around 13.5 million.”There is of course an ongoing cost of living crisis affecting people’s spending decisions. And there’s also an environmental price tag attached to every handset, all of which contain rare elements and precious metals.
In addition, there is a growing trend, especially among parents and young people, to try to step away from smartphones entirely.A number of UK schools are reviewing their smartphone policies, and a few have already opted for an outright ban. Pupils starting at the public school Eton this term were issued feature phones (sometimes, rather unpopularly known as dumb phones), and I have heard of several other institutions, both in the private and state sectors, which are considering following suit.The mobile phone network EE recommends that children below the age of 11shouldn’t have smartphones at all.Nova Eden leads the north and west London branch of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, which urges parents and schools to collaborate to delay the age at which children are given the devices.“We are not anti-tech, we are just pro-childhood,” she says. “We would like to see tech companies develop a child friendly phone, offering only essential features such as calls, messaging, music, and maps, without any additional functionalities.”
Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face, says that so far, this message does not seem to be getting through.“There’s increased talk of ‘digital sobriety’ in the way we build and use technology – but it sounds like smartphone designers are going in the exact opposite direction,” she says.I put this to Apple, Google and Samsung. The latter said: ""Samsung users can choose how they use their Galaxy phones that best fits their needs. For example, digital wellbeing features allow users to select what features they use, when they use them and for how long, such as setting a screen time limit on specific apps they want to restrict.""One company that is listening to the growing calls for reduced phone functionality is the Finnish firm HMD – which still makes basic Nokia handsets. Last month it launched a Barbie-themed phone in collaboration with toymaker Mattel, and I tried it out. The two words I would use to describe it are: functional. And pink.Like most feature phones, it has no apps, no app store, no selfie camera, and only one game. If you want to listen to music there’s an FM radio.CCS Insight forecasts that around 400,000 feature phones are likely to be sold in the UK this year – nowhere near enough to knock the iPhone off the top of the list of the world’s most-sold handsets any time soon, but not a bad market space.I just checked my own screentime over the past seven days, and I averaged around five hours per day, This is admittedly a sobering statistic – but it wasn’t all doomscrolling (honest). My phone is a work tool, it’s also what I use for banking, shopping, directions, health tracking and keeping track of family plans, as well as, yes, gaming and social media.
“I think the thing we always forget is that there's a tremendous amount of benefits from using smartphones,” says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa university, who has written extensively about the issue of screen time.“We tend to focus a lot more on the negatives. It's always worth bearing in mind that these are technologies of convenience. They help us. There are some good aspects to them as well.”"
Google scores rare legal win as 1.49bn euro fine scrapped,"Google has won its challenge against a €1.49bn (£1.26bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers.The bloc accused Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016.Europe's second-top court ruled the European Commission - which levied the fine - ""committed errors in its assessment"".The Commission said it would ""reflect on possible next steps"", which could include an appeal to the EU's top court.Google welcomed the ruling: ""We are pleased that the court has recognised errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,"" it said in a statement.""We will review the full decision closely,"" it added.It is a rare win for the tech giant, which was hit with fines worth a total of 8.2 billion euros between 2017 and 2019 over antitrust violations.It failed in its attemptto have one of those fines overturned last week.It is not just in Europe where it is under pressure over its highly lucrative ad tech business.Earlier this month, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)provisionally found it used anti-competitive practicesto dominate the market.TheUS government is also taking the tech giant to courtover the same issue, with prosecutors alleging its parent company, Alphabet, illegally operates a monopoly in the market.Alphabet has argued its market dominance is due to the effectiveness of its products.
Restrictive clauses
This case revolved around Google's AdSense product, which delivers adverts to websites - making Google almost like a broker for ads.The Commission concluded Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than AdSense when they were seeking adverts for their web pages.It said the firm then added other ""restrictive"" clauses to its contracts to reinforce its market dominance - and levied a €1.49bn fine as a penalty.In its ruling, the EU's General Court upheld the majority of the Commission’s findings - but annulled the decision by which the Commission imposed the fineIt said the Commission had not considered ""all the relevant circumstances"" concerning the contract clauses and how it defined the market.Because of this, it ruled the Commission did not establish ""an abuse of dominant position."""
Politicians say they can make social media less ‘addictive’. Experts aren’t so sure,"New York just passed a law on ""addictive"" social media feeds for children, but some researchers are questioning what that actually means.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul was clear about her opinion of social media earlier this month, speaking at a press conference toannounce the signing of two new state lawsdesigned to protect under-18-year-olds from the dangers the online world.
The apps are responsible for transforming ""happy-go-lucky kids into teenagers who are depressed"", she said, but according to Hochul, the legislation she signed off on would help. ""Today, we save our children,"" Hochul said. ""Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fuelled by addictive social media feeds.""
Starting in 2025, these new laws could force apps including TikTok and Instagram to send some children back to the earliest days of social media, before content was tailored by users' ""likes"" and tech giants collected data about our interests, moods, habits and more. TheStop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Actrequires social media platforms and app stores seek parental consent before children under 18 use apps with ""addictive feeds"", a groundbreaking attempt to regulate algorithmic recommendations. The SAFE Act will even prevent apps from sending notifications to child or teenage users between midnight and 6am – practically a legal bedtime for devices – and require better age verification to avoid children slipping through undetected. The second law, theNew York Child Data Protection Act, limits the information app providers collect about their users.
""By reining in addictive feeds and shielding kids' personal data, we'll provide a safer digital environment, give parents more peace of mind, and create a brighter future for young people across New York,"" Hochul explained.
The laws are part of growing concerns over the effects of social media on the mental health of young people. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recently went as far as calling forwarning labels for social media apps, similar to the notices on cigarette packaging. Inthe USand many parts of the world,young people are facing a mental health crisis, and even bigtech employees have acknowledgedthe harms they've caused some children.
Butthe science linking social mediaandmental health problemsisfar less clear than many assume. In fact, numerous studies have even shown social media can havebenefits for teenagers' mental health. It's led some technology analysts and child psychologists to call recent political interventions a ""moral panic"".
Some policy advocates and social media experts also question how easy legislative interventions like the SAFE Act will be to enforce. They say it could set back the much-needed efforts to address the real hazards of social media, such aschild sexual abuse material, privacy violations, hate speech,misinformation,dangerous and illegal contentand more.
Mixed messages
Many studies that do find a link with poor mental health outcomes focus on ""problematic social media use"", where individuals have a lack of regulation over their use of social media. This has been associated withincreased prevalence of various forms of anxiety, for example, but alsodepression and stress. Some studies suggest there is adose-related aspect at work, where negative mental health symptoms increase with time spent on social media. But other studies suggestsuch associations are weakor have evenfound no evidencethat pins the spread of social media to widespread psychological problems.
There are some studies that even suggest social media use in moderation can be beneficial in some circumstances by helping to create a sense of community.
Indeed, theUS Surgeon General's own advisoryon the impact of tech on young people suggests that it has as many positive benefits as negatives. According to the Surgeon General's report, 58% of young people said social media helped them feel more accepted, and 80% praised its ability to connect people with their friends' lives.
And there is even debate about whether problematic social media use is a growing problem at all. Onerecent meta-analysis of 139 studies from 32 countriesconcluded that there was no sign it had increased over the past seven years, apart from in low income countries where theprevalence of mental health conditions tends to be higher.
One problem that crops up regularly is that many of the studies in this area rely upon self-reported mood and usage patterns, which can lead to bias in the data, but also use such a wide variety of methods that they are not easily compared.
But this uncertainty in the science hasn't stopped the drumbeat of concern among child-protection campaigners and legislators. They argue thata precautionary principle is prudentand that more needs to be done to force big tech platforms to take action, with the two new pieces of legislation introduced by Hochul being just the latest move.
""There's a real sense of urgency about it all, that we must seen to be doing something right now this minute to fix the problem,"" says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, and the author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time.
""But just because it feels like an urgent problem to fix doesn't mean that the first solution that comes along would actually work.""
Mixed responses
Some experts in online safety have welcomed the new laws in New York.
""While New York's legislation is much broader and less targeted on concrete harms than theUK's Online Safety Act, it's clear that regulation is the only way that big tech will clean up its algorithms and stop children being recommended huge amounts of harmful suicide and self-harm content,"" says Andy Burrows, an advisor at the Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the parents of Molly Russell, a UK teenager who killed herself in 2017 after seeing a series of self-harm images on social media – a contributing factor to her death, according toa landmark rulingin 2022 by a London coroner.
Burrows says Hochul's swift actions should be seen favourably compared to the US Congress, which he claims ""drags its feet on passing comprehensive federal measures"".
""The bar is quite low and this legislation only stands out as better compared to the numerous pieces of bad legislation out there,"" says Jess Maddox, assistant professor in digital media at the University of Alabama. ""In terms of states in the US trying to regulate social media, this is some of the better attempts I've seen.""
She praises it for not preventing minors from using social media outright, as asimilar plan in Floridais attempting – a measure some worry will cause digital literacy issues and leave children less prepared for the future. ""This does put the onus on social media platforms to do something,"" says Maddox.
The response from social media platforms themselves has been mixed. Netchoice, an industry body that represents many of the major technology companies including Google, X, Meta and Snap, described the New York legislation as""unconstitutional"" and heavy handed. It warned the laws could even have unintended consequences such as potentially increasing the risk of children being exposed to harmful content by removing the ability to curate feeds and presenting possible privacy issues.
But a spokesperson for Meta, which runs Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said: ""While we don't agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognising the responsibility of app stores."" They pointed toresearchsuggesting the majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval, and added: ""We will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach.""
X, TikTok, Apple and Google, YouTube's parent company, did not respond to the BBC's request to comment for this story.
Laws mandating parental consent on social media have also faced legal hurdles. In February,a federal judge upheld a block on an Ohio lawthat required parents' permission before kids under 16 use social media.
When the SAFE Act faces inevitable scrutiny, the debate around the science could further dampen it's viability, says Ysabel Gerrard, senior lecturer in digital communication at the University of Sheffield in the UK, who has been studying the online safety movement. ""It takes as its premise that social media 'addiction' is a proven phenomenon, but it isn't,"" she says. ""While there's consensus that platforms are, by their very design, and as profit-seeking endeavours, aimed to be enjoyable for their users and to retain their attention, whether that should be classed as 'addiction' is still under debate.""
But Gerrard says the second piece of legislation, the New York Child Data Protection Act is stronger. ""I've long worried about the loss of control children – well, all of us – have over their data and the lack of knowledge we all have about where it goes,"" she says. She believes the law will require platforms to explain where they're using the data they're collecting, which would be a sea change. ""While I entirely agree with the principles behind this Act, I will be interested to see how it evolves, as it would require platforms to do something they haven't yet managed, and to society's detriment.""
Sam Spokony, a representative for Governor Hochul, declined to comment when contacted for a response to the criticism.
Enforcement troubles
There are those who also fear that the wrong approach to regulating social media platforms could ultimately have longer-term consequences.
While Maddox praises the acts for being better than some other state-level attempts, ""this is where my praise ends as it seems largely unenforceable"", she says. She points out that it's difficult to end ""addictive feeds"" in a single state, and compares it to online age verification laws that have effectively banned access to pornographic websites on a state-by-state basis in the US.
One concern is that verifying that social media feeds have been made less addictive once the law goes into effect is going to be difficult. That in itself will make it hard to enforce.
""In being unenforceable, I could see social media companies pointing to this as evidence they can't or shouldn't be regulated,"" says Maddox.
Another challenge is the many different approaches being taken by different states to regulate children's use of social media. Social media networks often transcend not just state boundaries but also international borders.Many key policy makers are sympatheticto the difficulty of implementing differing local restrictions. And already, this mixture of local laws has given social media companies room to challenge the legislation through the courts in places includingOhio,California,Arkansas.
Maddox fears that if such laws are rushed into place, it can do more harm than good in attempts to protect children online than legislation that has had time to be properly scrutinised.
More like this:
•The one simple change that will improve your media diet in 2024•US surgeon general wants social media warning labels•Adults and teens turn to 'dumbphones' to cut screen time
""For the short term, we may have done something, but in the long term, nothing will likely happen,"" she says.
She's not alone in that fear. ""I worry that folks in power are wasting precious time on something that is unenforceable,"" says Gerrard.
So do critics of the new legislation see a better alternative? ""Clearly in the long run it will be much better for all involved – and I think that also includes the tech companies – to have a single, well developed federal approach rather than a patchwork of 50 states taking separate approaches,"" says Burrows.
A unified, single approach that is based on evidence, and acts as a global standard would be preferable, say the experts, and the technology industry tends to agree. The nascent world of AI regulation offers models that could be adopted to social media as well. For example, lawmakers are fighting to mandate public algorithm audits to make companies open their AI systems to outside experts. However, it is an approach that still may require a global consensus: the UK, for instance, asks AI model makers to submit their products for analysis by its AI oversight body, but a number of firms have said they wouldn't do so because the jurisdiction is comparatively small.
In the meantime, individual states are pushing ahead with their attempts to protect children from what they might see and feel while using social media, while big tech also is pushing back. It seems clear that the war over the future of social media is only just getting started.

Instagram boosts privacy and parental control on teen accounts,"Instagram is overhauling the way it works for teenagers, promising more ""built-in protections"" for young people and added controls and reassurance for parents.The new “teen accounts” are being introduced from Tuesday in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.They will turn many privacy settings on by default for all under 18s, including making their content unviewable to people who don't follow them, and making them actively approve all new followers.But children aged 13 to 15 will only be able to adjust the settings by adding a parent or guardian to their account.Social media companies are under pressure worldwide to make their platforms safer, with concerns that not enough is being done to shield young people from harmful content.UK children's charity the NSPCC said Instagram’s announcement was a ""step in the right direction"".But it added that account settings can “put the emphasis on children and parents needing to keep themselves safe.""Rani Govender, the NSPCC’s online child safety policy manager, said they ""must be backed up by proactive measures that prevent harmful content and sexual abuse from proliferating Instagram in the first place”.Meta describes the changes as a ""new experience for teens, guided by parents"".It says they will ""better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place.""Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly viewed content about self-harm and suicide on Instagram before taking her life aged 14, told the BBC it was important to wait and see how the new policy was implemented.“Whether it works or not we’ll only find out when the measures come into place,"" he said.“Meta is very good at drumming up PR and making these big announcements, but what they also have to be good at is being transparent and sharing how well their measures are working.""
How will it work?
Teen accounts will mostly change the way Instagram works for users between the ages of 13 and 15, with a number of settings turned on by default.These include strict controls on sensitive content to prevent recommendations of potentially harmful material, and muted notifications overnight.Accounts will also be set to private rather than public - meaning teenagers will have to actively accept new followers and their content cannot be viewed by people who don't follow them.
Parents who choose to supervise their child's account will be able to see who they message and the topics they have said they are interested in - though they will not be able to view the content of messages.However, media regulator Ofcom raised concerns in Aprilover parents' willingness to intervene to keep their children safe online.In a talk last week, senior Meta executive Sir Nick Clegg said: “One of the things we do find… is that even when we build these controls, parents don’t use them.”
Age identification
The system will primarily rely on users being honest about their ages, but Instagramalready uses tools to verify a user's ageif they are suspected to be lying about their age.From January, in the US, it will use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to proactively detect teens using adult accounts, to put them back into a teen account.The UK's Online Safety Act, passed earlier this year, requires online platforms to take action to keep children safe, or face huge fines.Ofcom warned social media sites in Maythey could be named, shamed or banned for under-18sif they fail to comply with its new rules.Social media industry analyst Matt Navarra said Instagram's changes were significant, but hinged on enforcement.""As we've seen with teens throughout history, in these sorts of scenarios, they will find a way around the blocks, if they can,"" he told the BBC.
Questions for Meta
Instagram is not the first platform to introduce such tools for parents - and already claims to have more than 50 tools aimed at keeping teens safe.In 2022 it introduced a family centre and supervision tools for parents, letting them see accounts their child follows and who follows them, among other features.Snapchat also introduced its own family centre allowing parents over the age of 25 see who their child is messaging and limit their ability to view certain content.YouTube said in September itwould limit recommendations of certain health and fitness videos to teenagers, such as those which ""idealise"" certain body types.Instagram's new measures raises the question of why, despite the large number of protections on the platform, young people are still exposed to harmful content.An Ofcom studyearlier this yearfound that every single child it spoke to had seen violent material online, with Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat being the most frequently named services they found it on.Under theOnline Safety Act, platforms will have to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or content that promotes suicide or self-harm.But the rules are not expected to fully take effect until 2025.What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recently announced plans to ban social media for children by bringing in a new age limit for kids to use platforms.Instagram’s latest tools put more control in the hands of parents, who will now take even more direct responsibility for deciding whether to allow their child greater freedom on Instagram, and supervising their activity and interactions.They will also need to have their own Instagram account.But parents cannot control the algorithms which push content towards their children, or what is shared by its billions of users around the world.Social media expert Paolo Pescatore said it was an ""important step in safeguarding children’s access to the world of social media and fake news.""""The smartphone has opened up to a world of disinformation, inappropriate content fuelling a change in behaviour among children,"" he said.""More needs to be done to improve children’s digital wellbeing and it starts by giving control back to parents."""
TikTok says US ban would have ‘staggering’ impact on free speech,"TikTok argued in court on Monday that a US law - which would see it banned unless it is sold by ByteDance - would have a “staggering” impact on the free speech of its US users.The law was prompted by concerns that US users' data is vulnerable to exploitation by China's government.TikTok and ByteDance have repeatedly denied links to the Chinese authorities.The companies sued to block the legislation in early May, calling it unconstitutional and an effective ban on the speech of its 170 million US users.
A panel of three judges heard its arguments at an appeals court in Washington DC on Monday.""This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,"" TikTok and ByteDance's lawyer Andrew Pincus told the court.Concerns around China came up early, with Mr Pincus stating that the firm ""is not owned"" by the country.""The owner of TikTok is ByteDance Limited, a Cayman Islands holding company,” he said.But Judge Sri Srinivasan responded that the firm was ""subject to Chinese control"".Mr Pincus said the US government does not allege any malfeasance has taken place - and the firm was being punished over the suggestion that there might be issues in the future.But he was challenged on his argument that the law would be an unprecedented ban on a single speaker - and his claim that it would be ""unfeasible"" to divest the US arm of the firm.Judge Ginsberg argued the law is ""an absolute bar on the current arrangement of control"" of the company, not the company itself.He also said it targeted a group of companies controlled by a so-called foreign adversary, rather than TikTok alone.When and why could TikTok be banned in the US?
Constitutional right
Jeffrey Fisher, representing creators concerned by the law, said it could impede their constitutional right to work with the editor and publisher of their choice – such as TikTok under its current ownership.TikTok creator Tiffany Cianci, who is not among the creators involved in the lawsuit, was livestreaming outside the hearing to update viewers on proceedings.She told the BBC that 65,000 people tuned into her TikTok Live.""The American people care about this issue,"" she said. ""They're tuning in because they're worried about losing something.""
Ms Cianci added that the platform's use by politicians in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election felt ""hypocritical"" and made her doubt the security concerns at the heart of the controversial law.""If it were dangerous, they wouldn't be there,"" she said.Department of Justice lawyer Daniel Tenny argued against TikTok's defence that the code behind its platform is based in the United States.""There’s really no dispute here that the recommendation engine is maintained, developed, and written by ByteDance rather than TikTok US,"" he said.""It is not expression by Americans in America - it is expression by Chinese engineers in China.""Mr Fisher had claimed posts on the platform in the US were American speech that was ""at most curated by a foreign company"".In addition to data concerns, officials and lawmakers have expressed alarm at the prospect of TikTok being used by the Chinese government tospread propagandato Americans.However, advocates of America's powerful free speech rights, enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, have said upholding the divest-or-ban law would be a gift to authoritarian regimes everywhere.Xiangnong Wang, a staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said repressive regimes worldwide may use it to ""justify new restrictions on their own citizens’ right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad.""
'High stakes'
But according to James Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the law was drafted to withstand judicial scrutiny.""The substance of the case against TikTok is very strong,"" Mr Lewis said.""The key point is whether the court accepts that requiring divestiture does not regulate speech.""Mr Lewis added that the courts usually defer to the president on national security matters.Regardless of how the appeals court rules, most experts agree the case could drag on for months, if not longer.Gautam Hans, clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School, told the BBC he believes an appeal is likely either way.The government's ability to legislate and regulate where national security is concerned is ""paramount,"" he said.""They cannot have that limited by the courts.""But the issues are also ""existential"" for TikTok, he added, with the company saying it cannot divest and would as such have no choice but to shut down.Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at analysis firm Forrester, added the ""high stakes"" case would likely progress to the US' highest court, the Supreme Court.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
US TikTok ban: When and why could the app be outlawed?,"TikTok is beginning its case against a law which will ban it in the US unless it is sold by ByteDance, its Chinese parent company.The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of data and links to the government in Beijing.
Who wants to ban TikTok in the US and why?
Lawmakers from both major US political parties supported a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell to a non-Chinese company.They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users.TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government.In April, following approval by Congress, President Joe Biden signed a billpaving the way for TikTok's forced sale.Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed.Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020.But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook.Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Mr Trump as the Democrat candidate, has used TikTok and popular social media trends likeCharli XCX's ""brat"" to try and win over young voters.A spokesperson for her campaign haspreviously saidthey would ""just like to see a change in ownership"" of TikTok rather than its ban.
Is TikTok really a danger to the West?Can TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?
When could TikTok be banned?
Mr Biden signing the bill into law did not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok, but it did start a ticking clock.The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect.TikTok said this could mean it is either forced to sell or shut down in the US by 19 January 2025, after the US presidential election in November.But the company's fight against the legislation in court, which beganwhen it sued to block the law in May, could take years.
How would a TikTok ban work?
The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices.
App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok.It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs.The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US.It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.
What has TikTok said it will do about the ban?
Arguments in TikTok's appeal begin in a Washington DC court on Monday 16 September and will be heard by a three-judge panel.A group of TikTok creators who oppose the law over concerns about its impact on their workwill also make their case at the hearing.TikTok has previously called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech.""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told usersin a video, ""we aren't going anywhere"".He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk.
ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move.
How have TikTok users in the US responded?
Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban.Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work.
In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill.Butthe deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired.Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.
What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?US TikTok ban would be 'devastating', UK firms warn
Is TikTok banned in other countries?
It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere.TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020.It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission.The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phonesbecause of security fears.
How does TikTok work and how much user data does it collect?
At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material.Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system.This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing.But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users."
We're losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it?,"Research shows 25% of web pages posted between 2013 and 2023 have vanished. A few organisations are racing to save the echoes of the web, but new risks threaten their very existence.
It's possible, thanks to surviving fragments of papyrus, mosaics and wax tablets, to learnwhat Pompeiians ate for breakfast2,000 years ago. Understand enough Medieval Latin, and you can learn how many livestock were reared at farms in Northumberland in 11th Century England – thanks tothe Domesday Book, the oldest document held in the UK National Archives. Through letters and novels, the social lives of the Victorian era – and who they loved and hated – come into view.
But historians of the future may struggle to understand fully how we lived our lives in the early 21st Century. That's because of a potentially history-deleting combination of how we live our lives digitally – and a paucity of official efforts to archive the world's information as it's produced these days.
However, an informal group of organisations are pushing back against the forces of digital entropy – many of them operated by volunteers with little institutional support. None is more synonymous with the fight to save the web than the Internet Archive, an American non-profit based in San Francisco, started in 1996 as a passion project by internet pioneer Brewster Kahl. The organisation has embarked what may be themost ambitious digital archiving project of all time, gathering866 billion web pages, 44 million books, 10.6 million videos of films and television programmes and more. Housed in a handful of data centres scattered across the world, the collections of the Internet Archive and a few similar groups are the only things standing in the way of digital oblivion.
""The risks are manifold. Not just that technology may fail, but that certainly happens. But more important, that institutions fail, or companies go out of business. News organisations are gobbled up by other news organisations, or more and more frequently, they're shut down,"" says Mark Graham, director of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, a tool that collects and stores snapshots of websites for posterity. There are numerous incentives to put content online, he says, but there's little pushing companies to maintain it over the long term.
Despite the Internet Archive's achievements thus far, the organisation and others like it face financial threats, technical challenges, cyberattacks and legal battles from businesses who dislike the idea of freely available copies of their intellectual property. And as recent court losses show, the project of saving the internet could be just as fleeting as the content it's trying to protect.
""More and more of our intellectual endeavours, more of our entertainment, more of our news, and more of our conversations exist only in a digital environment,"" Graham says. ""That environment is inherently fragile.""
Saving our history
A quarter of all web pages that existed at some point between 2013 and 2023 now… don't. That's according to arecent studyby Pew Research Center, a think tank based in Washington, DC, which raised the alarm of our disappearing digital history. Researchers found the problem is more acute the older a web page is: 38% of web pages that Pew tried to access that existed in 2013 no longer function. But it's also an issue for more recent publications. Some 8% of web pages published at some point 2023 were gone by October that same year.
This isn't just a concern for history buffs and internet obsessives. According to the study, one in five government websites contains at least one broken link. Pew found more than half of Wikipedia articles have a broken link in their references section, meaning the evidence backing up the online encyclopaedia's information is slowly disintegrating.
But thanks to the work of the Internet Archive, not all those dead links are totally inaccessible. For decades, the Archive's Wayback Machine project has sent armies of robots to crawl through the cascading labyrinths of the internet. These systems download functional copies of websites as they change over time – often capturing the same pages multiple times in a single day – and make them available to public free of charge.
""When we then went and looked at how many of those URLs were available in the Wayback Machine, we found that two-thirds of those were available in a way,"" he says. In that sense, the Internet Archive is doing what it set out to do – it's saving records of online society for posterity.
A few other organisations, big and small, work on similar projects. The US Library of Congress, for example, preservesgovernment websites,thesites of congressmembersand acollection of US news sites. The Library of Congress also preserved a copy ofevery single tweetsent since the founding of Twitter (now known as X), until the project was shut down in 2017. Other governments run their own initiatives. TheUK Web Archiveconducts an annual crawl of websites with .UK domain names, capturing a snapshot of the British internet at least once a year. In 2022, band of volunteers to set out tosave the Ukrainian internetas it was hit by Russian cyberattacks.
But the scope of these projects is narrow, while the Internet Archive aims for a comprehensive approach. Given the available resources, it would be impossible to collect anything close to the whole internet, but its systems cast a broad net. Depending on what you're looking for, the Internet Archive's collection is so thorough it can sometimes feel like a functionally complete record of the web.
Success breeds complacency
The Archive's publicly accessible documents help sustain records of our lives in the current era. It's become a standard practise on Wikipedia to cite copies of websites from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, rather than the original websites themselves. The organisation also preserves a vast collection of media that predates the digital era. The beloved 1977 comedy seriesFernwood 2 Nightisn't available on any streaming service, but you can watch it free on the Internet Archive. Books, magazines and websitescite the Internet Archive’s scanned digital copies of booksthat are unavailable in physical libraries. It even acts as a preservation tool for the public; anyone can upload videos, websites and practically anything else to organisation's servers.
Among the major collections that the Wayback Machine has salvaged from the digital scrapheap aredeep records of websites built on GeoCities, a now defunct personal web hosting service. Long before social media, GeoCities was among the first platforms that made it easy for anyone to create their own website.Historiansview GeoCities asone of the most important chaptersin the early days of the world wide web, without the efforts of the Internet Archive, most of its websites would be lost. In more recent history, a US Congressional Committeerelied on the Internet Archiveto preserve article and documents related to the January 6 insurrection.
""Every few years there's a new platform come along and then the economic forces suddenly kind of collapse in it,"" says Andrew Jackson, preservation registry technical architect at the Digital Preservation Coalition, a UK-based advocacy group and charity that advises on how to preserve the world's online digital archives. ""That's one big source of churn.""
The tech news website CNET faced backlash in 2023 after reports thatthe company had deleted tens of thousands of articles, amounting to decades of lost history. Among CNET's responses was a promise that all its deleted articles had been preserved in the Wayback Machine. Many critics argued the company was taking the Internet Archive for granted, passing on its own archival responsibilities.
""Even though Google and other search engines actively incentivise you to maintain stable URLs, it's just technically quite difficult to do that,"" says Jackson. ""Every time a new company kind of revamped its website, it has to work out how much of its new URLs it's going to try and maintain through time.""
But it's worth remembering what the Internet Archive is: a non-profit organisation, financed by donations from charitable foundations. It makes for a never-ending project with exponentially growing costs. The Internet Archive volunteered to take on the mantle of being the world's leading library for our digital lives. As the web approaches its fourth decade, this entirely unofficial project has become a foundational pillar of the internet.
But as our reliance on the Internet Archive grows, so too do the threats pecking away at its efforts.
Single points of failure
Last week, the organisation announced amajor partnership with Google, where the tech giant engine will include links to the Wayback Machine in search results – though neither released financial details about the deal.
But other recent news demonstrates that the project is still fragile. That vulnerability was laid bare in acourt caseagainst the Internet Archive by four large book publishers, who alleged that the Internet Archive’s practise of scanning physical books and lending out digital copies breaches US copyright law. Before the pandemic, the Internet Archive would only lend one digital copy at a time for each physical book in its collection. But during the Covid shutdowns, the organisation lifted that restriction,letting patrons borrow unlimited digital copies of booksto try and make up for the closure of physical libraries.
A US courtruled that practice was illegalin 2023, and in early September, the Internet Archive’s appeal against that decision was rejected. The organisationpreviously saidthat it agreed to pay the a publishing industry trade group an undisclosed sum in relation to the case.
With that lawsuit in the rearview, the Internet Archive is fighting yet anothercourt case against music labelsfor digitising records that could cost it $400m (about £305m) if it loses. It's an amount that could jeopardise the non-profit's survival.
Internet Archive's director of library services Chris Freeland said the organisation is reviewing the courts' opiniona statementabout the ruling.
Existential legal battles aren't the only hazards menacing the world of digital preservation. The British Library's UK Web Archive got a taste of some malevolent technical challenges last whena cyberattacktook its digital systems offline in October 2023. Almost a year later, the UK Web Archive is still dealing with the fallout. Online access to much of its collection is still unavailable.
In May 2024,the Internet Archive announcedit was in the midst of a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, vandals or other bad actors set up automated systems to bombard websites with visits, attempting to push them offline by overwhelming their servers. At its peak, tens of thousands of concurrent visits were happening every second. Services, including the Wayback Machine, went down. It meant that the regular drumbeat of archiving was disrupted for a time, and there may be permanent gaps in the historical record as a result.
The Internet Archive ""was started byone individual, and it has become a kind of linchpin"", says Jackson. ""It also feels like this potential single point of failure. Although it's a lot more sophisticated than just volunteers, it is one institution in one region, under one legal framework.""
The organisation shares these concerns. If the Internet Archive's work stopped and ""that void wasn't immediately filled, then much of what is currently made available on the public web would be at risk"", says Graham.
He's clear that the Internet Archive won't step back from its responsibilities anytime soon, but the project can use outside help. ""There are opportunities for many others to contribute in a variety of ways,"" he says.
Shared responsibilities, split priorities
With no formal effort to organise efforts to preserve the internet, the project is left to hobbyists, volunteers, and a few groups of unofficial bodies that generally operate independently.
""It makes sense that the archival response is decentralised,"" says Mar Hicks, a historian of technology at the University of Virginia. ""But one of the problems is the varied priorities.""
Hicks points out that one of the first things any archivist will consider when building an archive is what to prioritise. ""And when it's so decentralised, the priorities are going to be very different,"" Hicks says. ""There's going to be people in groups who prioritise trying to grab everything – as much as they possibly can, they might be very completionist."" Then there will be others who are focused only on certain areas – for instance, the UK archiving effort.
The concern about such an ad hoc, decentralised approach is that it's possible there's overlap, meaning precious archiving resources are wasted getting duplicate or triplicate copies of the most popular websites – all while some areas that may have historical importance are overlooked because they fall between different groups' responsibilities.
""Archivists will tell you that these issues have existed for a very long time,"" Hicks says. But they're exacerbated by the level of stuff being produced in our digital world.Nearly a billion emailsare sent every day. YouTube reports thatmore than 500 hours'worth of video content is posted on the platform every minute.
The internet is ""essentially a firehose of information and material,"" says Hicks. ""It doesn't make sense to try to catch everything that comes out of the firehose. That wouldn't make sense from a resource standpoint.""
In one sense this is an old concern. ""We have, as historians, those same problems,"" says Hicks. ""We have a wealth of documents from the past. But we only have certain documents and certain people's voices, and a lot of those voices that were missing were incredibly important, and they've been erased.""
For Hicks, there needs to be some sort of priority about what is being saved from the digital footprints of our generation. Otherwise we run the risk that rapidly ballooning costs will sideline efforts to save the history of the web – not to mention the oceans of digital files that live offline.
""If you have to keep everything, it becomes very expensive,"" says Jackson of the Digital Preservation Coalition. ""There's often older content or less compelling content [that] gets lost by the wayside,"" he says.
""We're not capturing the non-Western world well,"" admits Jackson. ""There are gaps now around incompleteness in different cultural domains.""
And while many of those organisations work to fight against their biases and prejudices, they're often left to carry the weight of the task while governments and the companies that run the platforms and websites sit by. ""Independent groups of people, who are just caring about it and are willing to spend their free time doing it, are better resourced and more highly skilled than the institutions which are formally responsible,"" says Jackson.
More like this:•Why there’s so little left of the early internet•How will future archaeologists study us?•Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same
There's a vacuum, argues Hicks, which few people other than a handful of archivist obsessives are filling. ""It's not clear whose responsibility it is to archive [the internet] or whose interest it would serve,"" Hicks says.
One thing is clear, though, Hicks says, we should all pay up to support the fight for preservation. ""From a very pragmatic perspective, if you do not pay these people and make sure that these archives are funded, they will not exist into the future, they will break down and then the whole point of collecting them will have gone out the window,"" says Hicks. ""Because the whole point of the archive is not that it just gets collected, but that it persists indefinitely into the future.""
The Enlightenment of the 18th century saw the birth ofan international library movementas governments and philanthropists took on the need to preserve and distribute books for the public. But that sense of civic responsibility hasn't extended to the internet. That may be due to the complicated business interests of the digital world, or just the immense technical challenge. Or, perhaps, it's because it doesn't feel like the web needs saving to casual observers. A book is a more obviously finite resource; it can be lost or damaged. But the internet feels so accessible. Anyone with an internet connection can pull up a web browser and dial in a URL. It's all right there – until it isn't.

Cristiano Ronaldo hits 1bn social media followers,"Cristiano Ronaldo has hit 1bn total followers across his various social media accounts - making him the first person to reach that mind-boggling figure.The number is calculated by combining his total number of followers across Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Chinese social media sites  Weibo and Kuaishou.It does not equate to one billion individual followers, as many people will follow him across multiple platforms, and some will be fake accounts, known as bots.Nonetheless social media expert Paolo Pescatore, from PP Foresight, described it as a ""staggering number"" that media and brands would pay close attention to.""What an achievement, and it further underlines the fundamental shift taking place in media.""It showed ""the power to reach new, younger audiences thanks to technology"", he told the BBC.On the pitch, Ronaldo was famed for his rivalry with Argentinian star Lionel Messi.But off it, there is no competition for who is winning the social media contest - Messi has a mere 623 million followers.It's not just sport: Ronaldo is also ahead of some of the biggest names in entertainment, including singers Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez.Even those known primarily for their work online cannot compete - MrBeast, the top YouTuber in the world, has 543m total followers.
Breaking 1bn
Part of the reason the footballer crossed the 1bn boundary first comes down to his decision to join YouTube last month, where his channel rocketed to 50 million subscribers within a single week.Compare that to Messi, whose channel has just 3.5m subscribers, despite having uploaded videos since 2011.The reason for the difference comes down to the rule that governs YouTube: content is king.Messi's channel has only uploaded one video in the past three years,a flashy ad for a football experiencebased around him that lasts half a minute.His other videos are similarly short - while the longer ones are usually montages or feature him speaking in his native Spanish.Ronaldo, Mbappé and a record-breaking commentSo far, Ronaldo's channel consists mainly of conversations between him and his wife Georgina Rodríguez, as well as his former Manchester United colleague Rio Ferdinand.But all this content has been tailored for an English-speaking audience - and even when Ronaldo is talking in Spanish or Portuguese,the videos are often dubbed into English.That, coupled with near-daily uploads and bright and colourful YouTube thumbnails. show Ronaldo (or more likely his social media team) know exactly how to make a video popular on the platform.He announced the news in a post shared across his various social media platforms.
Cristiano Ronaldo has made a career out of breaking records.His successes include being top scorer in Uefa Champions League history, having the most goals in the European Championship, and making more international appearances than anyone else.Last week he became the first footballer to score 900 top-level career goals.As with his playing career, he still has scope to improve his numbers on social media too, as unlike some of his rivals, he is not on TikTok or Threads.All of which is likely to add to another figure he dominates: earnings.According to Forbes, his total earnings now stand at $260 million- the highest of any athlete."
Stephen Fry: Musk and Zuckerberg have 'polluted culture',"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and X owner Elon Musk are ""the worst polluters in human history"", Stephen Fry has said.The actor and comedian made the claim during a lecture at Kings College, London.""You and your children cannot breathe the air or swim in the waters of our culture without breathing in the toxic particulates and stinking effluvia that belch and pour unchecked from their companies into the currents of our world,"" he said of the pair.The BBC has approached the two men's companies for comment.Mr Fry has a track record of being an early adopter of technology - and was once a regular poster on X, when it was known as Twitter.He stopped posting in 2022, a few months after the platform was purchased by Mr Musk, but has retained his account. He is no longer active on any social networks.""I’m the chump who thought social media could change the world,"" he told his audience at the Digital Futures Institute.He said he was at first enthusiastic about the potential of social media to unite people around the world and bring about positive change in society, citing the Arab Spring protests which were coordinated online as an example – but added that he had been proved wrong.He described what he considered to be a fatal flaw in attempts by early Facebook algorithms to “maximise engagement”, saying nobody had predicted that engagement would be “most maximised by... the worst passions"" such as anger, shock and horror.“We are decidedly hopeless at knowing where technology will take us or what it will do to us,” he said.He returned to the theme several times throughout his one hour speech, in which he also considered the future of artificial intelligence.Mr Fry argued that AI was “poised to disrupt every space we have”.He said he hoped corporate greed would not corrupt the development of AI tech at the expense of safety.“The best I can do is this – Einstein and Russell said in their manifesto on nuclear weapons – we appeal as human beings to human beings, remember your humanity and forget the rest,” he said.Mr Fry's broadside was not the only attack on Mr Musk.Earlier on Thursday, senior Meta executive Sir Nick Clegg, talking at Chatham House, in London, had been similarly scathing of Mr Musk’s platform X.The former deputy prime minister called it “a tiny, elite, news-obsessed, politics-obsessed app” and added that in his view the social network had become “a one-man hyper-partisan hobby horse.""In March 2024 X claimed to have 550 million monthly visitors.  Facebook has just over 3bn.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
Vodafone clashes with watchdog over Three merger,"Vodafone and Three have rejected claims by the UK's competition watchdog that their proposed merger would lead to higher prices for millions of mobile users.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ""provisionally concluded"" the deal would weaken competition between mobile networks.It has particular concerns that customers who are least able to afford mobile services would be most affected.The findings are the latest from the CMA's ongoing probe into the merger,which it launched in January.
The regulator will now consult on its findings and potential solutions to its worries over competition.These solutions could include legally binding investment commitments, and measures to protect both retail and wholesale customers.Vodafone's CEO for European Markets, Ahmed Essam, told the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4, that he still believed the merger would make a better network for customers, and add to the competition in the market.""We've made a significant commitment to an £11bn investment,"" he said.""We're willing to make sure that this is legally binding, and we undertake a commitment to deploy this.""He also said the firm had already traded part of its radio spectrum with a competitor.But the CMA said it is ""not convinced"" that it would be good for consumers.""The main knockback to the merging parties is that the CMA considers claims of superior network quality post integration to be ""overstated"","" said Kester Mann from analysis firm CCS Insight.But he said the regulator was not shutting the door on the deal.""Vodafone and Three should be encouraged by the tone of the CMA's report, which appears more open to the merger than I was expecting.""But Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which?, took a different view.""The regulator's finding has set a high bar for the merger to proceed,"" she said.""It is clear from those findings that the planned merger between Vodafone and Three could have a negative impact on millions of consumers.""But she warned it would be ""challenging"" for the regulator to find remedies for its concerns.
Biggest mobile network
Vodafone and Three revealed plans to merge their UK-based operations in June last year, creating the biggest mobile network in the UK with around 27 million customers.But the CMA provisionally concluded on Wednesday that such a deal would lead to a ""substantial lessening in competition"".In addition to worries over price and service levels, the regulator is also concerned that the deal may make it more difficult for smaller players such as Lyca Mobile, Sky Mobile and Lebara - who rent space from the bigger operators - to get a good deal.Vodafone and Three have said the tie-up would lead to an additional investment of £11bn in the UK.The CMA found that a merger of the two could improve the quality of mobile networks and accelerate next generation 5G networks and services, as claimed by the companies.But it considered these claims were ""overstated"", and that the merged firm would not necessarily have the incentive to carry out planned investment after the merger.In a statement, Vodafone and Three said they disagreed with the CMA's findings.""By all measures, the merger is pro-growth, pro-customer and pro-competition. It can, and should, be approved by the CMA,"" they said.The CMA will issue a final report into the deal in December.The firms added they would be working with the regulator to secure approval for the tie-up."
"Data centres as vital as NHS and power grid, government says","Data centres in the UK are to be classified as critical national infrastructure, joining the emergency services, finance and healthcare systems, and energy and water supplies.It means they would get extra government support during a major incident, such as a cyber attack, an IT outage or extreme weather, in order to minimise disruption.Data centres are huge warehouses full of vast banks of computers that remotely power services such as artificial intelligence (AI) applications, data processing and streaming.Their development has faced criticism over their energy and water use.But the new Labour government says it backs the sector - with technology secretary Peter Kyle describing data centres as “the engines of modern life”.
There are currently 13 sectors listed as critical national infrastructure in the UK. The list was last updated nine years ago, when space and defence were added.The previous government launched a consultation in December 2023 to discuss the potential addition of data centres.A team of officials will now be set up to specifically monitor potential threats against data centres and coordinate a response in the event of a serious incident, such as the recent worldwide chaos sparked by an update from the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, whichaffected millions of people and businesses.However there will not be any new regulations, nor is additional scrutiny of data centre operators’ existing contingency arrangements planned.“It’s not surprising that data centres are now to be classed as critical infrastructure as they house so many critical online services,” said Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert from Surrey University.“Many people think of services as being in an ethereal cloud, but everything is based at some point on physical infrastructure and more often than not this is based in a data centre.”In 2023 the former deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden warned of Russian “attempts to attack British infrastructure"".Lindy Cameron, the former boss of the National Cyber Security Centre, saidmore needed to be done to protect it from cyber threats.“Bringing data centres into the Critical National Infrastructure regime will allow better coordination and cooperation with the Government against cyber criminals and unexpected events,” she said.The need for data centres is growing, in part because of the proliferation of AI-based services, which require considerable computing power.On Wednesday, Amazon Web Services announced it will invest £8bn building and operating data centres in Britain over the next five years.Microsoft and Google are separately building their first UK such premises at the moment.But environmental concerns about data centres and their demand on resources remain - they areenergy-hungryand can require large quantities of water for cooling.The chief executive of the National Grid said in March that data centre power use in the UKwould increase six-fold in the next decade.Plans to build the data centres also often run into local opposition - in June, councillors in Buckinghamshire rejected a proposed developmentbecause of its impact on the green belt.Bruce Owen from Equinix, which runs data centres in the UK, told the Today Programme, on BBC Radio 4, he was ""really encouraged"" by the move.“The UK, for us, as a global data centre provider, is a critical market,"" he said.“Over our history within the UK we’ve invested over a billion pounds and we’re very encouraged by this signal, and therefore it encourages us to continue to invest and serve our customers in the UK.”"
New tech to improve cancer detection and treatment,"State-of-the-art technology that improves detection rates for cancer and other diseases will be officially unveiled at an East Yorkshire hospital on Friday.The cyclotron generates particles or radiotracers which are used to detect cancer and conditions such as Alzheimer's, heart and liver disease.The equipment is at the new Molecular Imaging Research Centre at Castle Hill Hospital, near Cottingham.Prof Nick Stafford, who founded the Daisy Appeal which raised money for the £9m centre, said it was the only one of its kind in the north of England.
""It can bring early diagnosis of a number of conditions, and a lot of centres can't do it,"" he said.""It is good news for Hull in terms of medical technology and accurate detection.""Some patients are having to travel to London at the moment. Once we're fully up and running, patients won't have to make long journeys south.""Other medical facilities in the UK that use similar technology are in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Cardiff.
The cyclotron, which cost more than £1m, was delivered to the East Yorkshire site in 2022 but the project was delayed by the pandemic.Prof Stafford said: ""This will not only allow very accurate detection but also allow much more specific pinpointing of disease, and I think it will bring early diagnosis in a number of cases.""There is incontrovertible evidence that the earlier that you catch a cancer, the more likely a cure is when you treat it.""After the official handover on Friday, work will begin on testing, commissioning and licensing, with the first radiotracers expected to be produced at the start of 2025.Listen to highlights fromHull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch thelatest episode of Look Northor tell us about a story you think we should be coveringhere."
Sony reveals much more expensive and powerful PlayStation 5 Pro,"After years of rumour, speculation and hype, Sony has confirmed it is launching a more powerful - and much more expensive - version of its hugely popular PlayStation 5 console.The PS5 Pro will be able to show more advanced graphics and display the most demanding games at higher, more consistent frame rates.But that added power will come at a cost: the PS5 Pro will be the most expensive console from Sony to date.It will cost £699.99 when it launches on 7 November this year - hundreds of pounds more than the PS5.""The price point of the PS5 Pro will inevitably cause a lot of commentary,"" analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from research firm Ampere said.He said the firm appeared to be betting that the console's improved performance would encourage users to upgrade their existing hardware and spend more on software.Mark Cerny, lead architect of the PS5, said it was ""the most powerful console we’ve ever built"".He said it sought to resolve a problem gamers had faced for years - whether to play a console game in so-called ""fidelity mode"", which favours visuals, or ""performance mode"", which makes a game smoother, though at the cost to how it looks.He said the PS5 Pro was about ""removing that decision, or at least narrowing that divide"".GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was ""a very targeted console"" for PlayStation's ""most enthusiastic audience"".""The console industry has had a tough time this year, with falling sales of PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and the ageing Nintendo Switch,"" he said.""PS5 Pro isn't going to change that situation.""But he said Sony might have one eye on the most anticipated game in the world - Grand Theft Auto VI - which is due to release next year.""When GTA 6 does launch, PlayStation will be able to say to players that the game will look best on PS5 Pro,"" he said.
Pro consoles
Companies have released updated versions of their own consoles with minor revisions for decades, but this release indicates the comparatively new trend of ""pro"" hardware is here to stay.Generally, this means hardware changes to current-generation consoles that lets games look better - but critically these tweaked consoles don't have exclusive games.In other words, games will still be released for PS5, and gamers can choose whether to play them on a regular console or a pro model with differences in graphics and performance.Paul Tamburro, from news website PlayStation LifeStyle, said fans had been hoping the console could ""bridge the gap"" between performance and fidelity modes, and the upgrade would help.""However, it also feels that the console doesn't do enough to justify that steep price point,"" he said.""It launching without a disc drive and still only targeting 60 FPS is disappointing.""This isn't an easy sell to current PS5 owners.""It's Sony's second major foray into this space after 2016's PS4 Pro, which brought 4k graphics to the original PlayStation 4.And it comes three years after Nintendo released its own take on a pro model - a Nintendo Switch with a larger, better screen.
Graphics leap
Today's announcement from Sony is not as significant as the PS4's jump to 4k graphics, but it still represents a step forward in home consoles.It comes at a time when PCs have been getting increasingly powerful, with the release of Nvidia's Geforce 40 series of graphics cards in 2022, which have put PCs firmly ahead of home consoles in the race for the best visuals.But it's worth remembering just one of these graphics cards can cost as much as a whole PS5, so consoles tend to strike a balance between the best visuals and the best price.Like with the last console generation, this release means Sony will now have multiple versions of its PS5 available to consumers, with different price points and specs.Rumours spread widely ahead of the announcement, with fans speculating on the features an upgraded console might have.Chief among them were unsourced claims that the PS5 Pro would be backwards compatible with games from previous Sony consoles - with some reports suggesting this would go as far back as the original PlayStation.There was nothing in the announcement to confirm the rumours."
EU court rules Google must pay €2.4bn fine,"Europe's top court has ruled Google must pay a €2.4bn (£2bn) fine handed down for abusing the market dominance of its shopping comparison service.The tech giant had appealed against the fine, which was originally levied by the European Commission in 2017.It was at the time the largest penalty the Commission had ever imposed - though it has since been supplanted by a €4.3bn fine, also against Google.Google said it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling.It brings an end to a long-running case that was first brought by British firm Foundem in 2009, when the UK was still part of the EU.Another of the complainants, shopping comparison site Kelkoo, called the ruling ""a win for fair competition and consumer choice""in a post on X.The European Court of Justice (ECJ), which made today's judgement, said in its ruling the Commission was right to find Google's conduct ""discriminatory"" and its appeal ""must be dismissed in its entirety"".It ordered Google and owner Alphabet to bear their own costs and pay the costs incurred by the European Commission.In a statement, Google pointed out it had made changes in 2017 to comply with the European Commission's decision.""Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,"" it said.Anne Witt, professor of law at EDHEC Business School's Augmented Law Institute, said it was ""an important judgement"".""This is bad news for Google, which has exhausted its legal remedies in this case,"" she said - while pointing out there could be further problems ahead for the firm.""Several follow-on actions by injured parties claiming compensation for losses suffered as a consequence of Google's anticompetitive conduct are already pending in national courts.""On Monday, Google was taken to court by the US government over its ad tech business - it has been accused of illegally operating a monopoly. That trial is ongoing.Last week,UK regulators provisionally concludedGoogle used anti-competitive practices to dominate the market for online advertising technology.
Rivals squeezed
The EU's case against Google started with Foundem, which filed its complaint against the tech giant in 2009.At its heart was the contention that Google made its own shopping recommendations appear more prominent than rivals in search results.Google had tried to argue that the case had no legal or economic merit.But seven years ago, the Commission agreed that the tech giant effectively monopolised online price comparison by preventing others from getting a foothold in the market.That decision has now been upheld.Industry insiders have been keeping a close eye on the EU case, with suggestions that its outcome may illuminate the direction of travel of the many other antitrust cases Google is currently facing from the European Commission.The search giant has amassed fines of €8.2bn from the Commission, which has repeatedly alleged it abused its dominant market position. These are:2017: €2.4bn fine over shopping results2018: €4.3bn fine over claims it used Android software to unfairly promote its own apps2019: €1.5bn fine for blocking adverts from rival search enginesThe EU is also currently investigating the firm over whether it preferences its own goods and services over others in search results, as part of its Digital Markets Act.If it finds Google guilty, the firm could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual turnover.It is far from the only clash between the EU and big tech.In a separate judgement today, the ECJ hastold Apple it must pay back €13bn (£11bn; $14bn) in unpaid taxesto Ireland."
Apple banks on AI to boost sales of new iPhone 16,"With business slumping, Apple has been under pressure to show what it will offer buyers to jumpstart a new wave of iPhone sales.On Monday, the technology giant revealed its hand - the iPhone 16 which has a camera button on the outside of the handset.The button is an external clue to the changes Apple said it had made inside its latest smartphone, aimed at harnessing the latest in artificial intelligence (AI).Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said the upgrades would ""push the boundaries of what a smartphone can do"" but the firm has tough competition, as other brands have already integrated generative AI features into their handsets.
Apple's share price fell during its  ""Glowtime"" event, where it unveiled the iPhone 16 as well as other products, and ended the day flat. The company, worth $3 trillion, is facing concern that it is losing its edge in the burgeoning area of artificial intelligence.Sales of the iPhone - Apple's most important product which accounts for around half of its total sales - have stalled in recent months. They slipped by 1% over the nine months ended 29 June compared with a year earlier.Apple said its new phones, which come with longer lasting batteries, more powerful chips and enhanced privacy features, were its first built specifically to handle AI and its new ""Apple Intelligence"" tools, many of which were announced in June.Those include new tools for writing and creating new emojis as well incorporating OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT into Siri to help users with some queries and text generation requests.On Monday, Apple also announced updates to its Apple Watch and its AirPod headphones, which will allow them to automatically drop the volume when users start in-person conversations and to decline calls with the shake of a head.It said the Pro version of its AirPods would be able to be used as a ""clinical grade"" personal hearing aid for people with mild or moderate hearing loss.The company said it was expecting marketing approval from regulators for the device ""soon"" and the feature would be available this autumn in more than 100 countries, including the US, Germany and Japan.Previously, the company had a feature that allowed people to pair hearing aids with iPhones and other devices.The products were rolled out at a glossy event where protestors gathered in a designated free speech area across the street, urging executives to ramp up efforts to protect children from dangerous content in the company’s App Store.The protest featured a life-sized blow-up made to resemble Mr Cook.
Sales of the new range start in September, with prices for the iPhone16 starting at $799.But the Apple Intelligence features are not set to be available on operating systems until October, starting in the US and heading to other countries in the following months. They will be available in the UK in December.Ben Wood, chief analyst at the market research firm CCS Insight, said it was likely that many people would dismiss the company's new camera control as a ""glorified shutter button"".But he said it offered ""very significant"" upgrades, including visual, AI-powered search and he came away from the presentation persuaded that Apple would win over customers.""The combination of Apple Intelligence and new camera features on the iPhone 16 will help spur upgrades from loyal Apple customers,"" he said. ""Particularly as Apple is positioning this latest update as being a future-proof purchase for customers wanting to get Apple Intelligence features as they roll out over the next few years.""
Apple has been slower than rivals Samsung and Google to bake generative AI features for photo editing, translation and web browsing into its devices.Competitors are now building them into folding, flipping and even tri-folding smartphones.Pre-orders for Huawei's new tri-fold phone, the Mate XT,reportedlyhit more than three million on Monday.Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said because Apple was rolling out AI-ready smartphones later than rivals, it was ""critical"" they deliver.She warned that rolling the features out before they were ready could risk their reputation or prompt sales losses."
Google's lucrative ad tech business goes on trial,"The US government is taking aim at the engine of Google's immense wealth - its extremely lucrative ad tech business.A trial beginning on Monday will hear the Department of Justice's case that the search engine's parent company Alphabet illegally operates a monopoly in the market.The companyearned more than $200 billion(£152bn) last year through the placing and selling of ads seen by internet users.Alphabet has argued its success is due to the ""effectiveness"" of its services - but prosecutors say it has used its market dominance to stifle rivals.“It is a really important industry that grabs billions of consumer dollars every year,” said Laura Phillips-Sawyer, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.“I think all consumers have an interest in this litigation.""It is the second major antitrust case the tech giant has faced in the US.In August a judge ruled itsdominance of search was illegal, with the penalties Google and Alphabet will face as a result of that decision so far unclear.
Anticompetition claims
According to the lawsuitfiled by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and a coalition of statesin 2023, Google dominates the digital ad marketplace and has leveraged its market power to stifle innovation and competition.Google meanwhile contends it is just one of several hundred companies that facilitate the placement of digital ads in front of consumers.It argues that competition in the digital ad space is growing, not contracting - citing increased ad growth and revenues for companies such as Apple, Amazon and TikTok as proof in a blog postresponding to the DoJ's lawsuitin 2023.
Both sides will present their cases to US District Judge Leonie Brinkema, who is expected to deliver a verdict.The bench trial comes on the heels of a landmark decision last month in a different monopoly case brought by the Justice Department against Google.Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google acted illegally to squelch competition in its online search business.“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” he wrote.
Make up or break up
During last year's trial, Google said it dominated online search because it had a better product.And the company is seemingly deploying a similar defence in the ad tech case.When asked for a statement, it referred the BBC to its 2023 blog post, in which it states that “no-one is forced to use our advertising technologies – they choose to use them because they’re effective.""Judge Mehta held a status conference on Friday as he begins the process of deciding on remedies for Google’s conduct.“The DoJ clearly had a big win, and they’re going to ride that momentum,” Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told the BBC.He said he expects those remedies to involve ""business model tweaks, not a breakup"" of the company.Meanwhile, in Justice Brinkema’s courtroom, the arcane process that governs advertising technology could make the DoJ's attempts to prove its case an uphill climb.“We all use search. We all intuitively understand that product,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.By comparison, advertising technology is “so complex that I think that’s going to be a real challenge for the government to make a clear, simple monopolisation argument here.”The US is not the only country where regulators are unhappy with Google's ad tech business.On Friday, the UK Competition and Markets Authority said it believed Google was abusing its dominance in the ad tech industry, according tothe findings of its initial investigation.It said it found that Google used anti-competitive practices to dominate the market for online advertising technology - and the potentially unlawful behaviour could be harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers.A Google representative said the decision was based on a ""flawed"" understanding of the ad tech sector."
Thieves snatched his phone in London - it was in China a month later,"Early on a Saturday morning in April, Akara Etteh was checking his phone as he came out of Holborn tube station, in central London.A moment later, it was in the hand of a thief on the back of an electric bike - Akara gave chase, but they got away.He is just one victim of anestimated 78,000 ""snatch thefts""in England and Wales in the year to March, a big increase on the previous 12 months.The prosecution rate for this offence is very low - the police say they are targeting the criminals responsible but cannot ""arrest their way out of the problem"". They also say manufacturers and tech firms have a bigger role to play.Victims of the crime have been telling the BBC of the impact it has had on them - ranging from losing irreplaceable photos to having tens of thousands of pounds stolen.And for Akara, like many other people who have their phone taken, there was another frustration: he was able to track where his device went, but was powerless to get it back.
Phone pings around London
He put his iPhone 13 into lost mode when he got home an hour or so later - meaning the thieves couldn't access its contents - and turned on the Find My iPhone feature using his laptop.This allowed Akara to track his phone's rough location and almost immediately he received a notification to say it was in Islington. Eight days later, the phone was pinging in different locations around north London again.In a move he says he ""wouldn't recommend"" with hindsight, he went to two of the locations his phone had been in to ""look around"".""It was pretty risky,"" he said. ""I was fuelled by adrenaline and anger.""
He didn't speak to anyone, but he felt he was being watched and went home.""I am really angry,"" he said. ""The phone is expensive. We work hard to earn that money, to be able to buy the handset, and someone else says 'screw that'.""Then, in May, just over a month after the theft, Akara checked Find My iPhone again - his prized possession was now on the other side of the world - in Shenzhen, China.Akara gave up.It is not uncommon for stolen phones to end up in Shenzhen - where if devices can't be unlocked and used again,they are disassembled for parts.The city is home to 17.6 million people and is a big tech hub, sometimes referred to as China's Silicon Valley.
Police could not help
In the moments after Akara’s phone was stolen, he saw police officers on the street and he told them what had happened. Officers, he said, were aware of thieves doing a “loop of the area” to steal phones, and he was encouraged to report the offence online, which he did.A few days later, he was told by the Metropolitan Police via email the case was closed as “it is unlikely that we will be able to identify those responsible”.Akara subsequently submitted the pictures and information he had gathered from the locations where his stolen phone had been. The police acknowledged receipt but took no further action.The Metropolitan Police had no comment to make on Akara’s specific case, but said it was “targeting resources to hotspot areas, such as Westminster, Lambeth and Newham, with increased patrols and plain clothes officers which deter criminals and make officers more visibly available to members of the community”.
Lost photos of mum
Many other people have contacted the BBC with their experiences of having their phones taken. One, James O’Sullivan, 44, from Surrey, says he lost more than £25,000 when thieves used his stolen device's Apple Pay service.Meanwhile, Katie Ashworth, from Newcastle, explained her phone was snatched in a park along with her watch, and a debit card in the phone case.“The saddest thing was that the phone contained the last photos I had of my mum on a walk before she got too unwell to really do anything - I would do anything to get those photos back,"" the 36-year-old says.Again, she says, there was a lack of action from the police.""The police never even followed it up with me, despite my bank transactions showing exactly where the thieves went,"" she said.""The police just told me to check Facebook Marketplace and local second-hand shops like Cex.""
'Battle against the clock' for police
So why are the police seemingly unable to combat this offence - or recover stolen devices?PC Mat Evans, who has led a team working on this kind of crime for over a decade within West Midlands Police, admitted that only ""quite a low number"" of phones that are stolen actually get recovered.He says the problem is the speed with which criminals move.""Phones will be offloaded to known fences within a couple of hours,"" he said.""It's always a battle against the clock immediately following any of these crimes, but people should always report these things to the police, because if we don't know that these crimes are taking place, we can't investigate them.""And sometimes just one arrest can make a difference.""When we do catch these criminals, either in the act or after the fact, our crime rates tank,"" he said.""Quite often that individual has been responsible for a huge swathe of crime.""
But the problem is not just about policing.In a statement, Commander Richard Smith from the National Police Chiefs' Council, which brings together senior officers to help develop policing strategy, said it would ""continue to target"" the most prolific criminals.""We know that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem,"" he said.""Manufacturers and the tech industry have an important role in reducing opportunities for criminals to benefit from the resale of stolen handsets.""
Tracking and disabling
Stolen phones can already be tracked and have their data erased through services such as ""Find My iPhone"" and ""Find My Device"", from Android.But policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said this week the government wanted manufacturers to ensure that any stolen phone could be permanently disabled to prevent it being sold second-hand.Police chiefs will also be tasked with gathering more intelligence on who is stealing phones and where stolen devices end up.A growing demand for second-hand phones, both in the UK and abroad, is believed to be a major driver behind the recent rise in thefts, the government said.The Home Office is to host a summit at which tech companies and phone manufacturers will be asked to consider innovations that could help stop phones being traded illegally.
PC Evans said there was ""no magic bullet"", but he said there was one thing manufacturers could do which would be ""enormously helpful"" to the police - more accurate tracking.""At this moment in time, phone tracking is okay,"" he said.""But it's not that scene in Total Recall yet, where you're able to run around with a tracking device in your hand, sprinting down the road after a little bleeping dot.""I appreciate it's a big ask from the phone companies to make that a thing, but that would be enormously helpful from a policing perspective.""Apple and Android did not provide the BBC with a statement, but Samsung said it was ""working closely with key stakeholders and authorities on the issue of mobile phone theft and related crimes"".Additional reporting by Tom Singleton"
"Google abusing ad tech dominance, UK competition watchdog finds","Google uses anti-competitive practices to dominate the market for online advertising technology, a UK watchdog has provisionally found.The potentially unlawful behaviour could be harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers, an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned.It accuses Google of preventing rivals from ""competing on a level playing field"" with its own tech for the billions of pounds spent by UK businesses on online advertising.Google said the watchdog's findings were ""flawed"" and said it would respond.According to the CMA, the vast majority of businesses use Google’s services when placing digital ads on websites.Google maintains it has a strong business incentive to help UK firms thrive, and argues that advertisers choose to use Google because its products work well and help their businesses grow.The watchdog will now consider representations from Google before deciding what action to take.If Google is found to have broken competition law, the watchdog could impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of annual worldwide group turnover and issue legally binding directions to the firm.“We’ve provisionally found that Google is using its market power to hinder competition when it comes to the ads people see on websites,"" Juliette Enser, the CMA's interim executive director of enforcement, said in a statement.She pointed out that many businesses were able to keep their digital content free by using revenue from digital adverts, which reach millions of people across the UK.“That’s why it’s so important that publishers and advertisers – who enable this free content – can benefit from effective competition and get a fair deal when buying or selling digital advertising space,” she wrote.But Google's vice president of global ads, Dan Taylor argued the search giant's advertising technology helped websites and apps fund their content, and effectively reach new customers.""The core of this case rests on flawed interpretations of the ad tech sector. We disagree with the CMA's view and we will respond accordingly,"" he wrote.Google’s activities in ad tech are also subject to continuing probes by the US Department of Justice and the European Commission.Competition economist Dr Cristina Caffarra, told the BBC that while the CMA's statement of objections certainly presented ""another headache"" for Google, the regulator was merely ""joining the club"" of those who have already taken action.""The UK is by no means some sort of pathfinder here,"" she said.The Department of Justice, state of Texas - which along with nine other statessued Google over alleged abuse of its ad tech dominancein 2020 - and the EU are all far ahead, Dr Caffarra added.In 2023, EU competition regulators told Google it might need to sell part of its ad-tech business to address their concerns.But the tech-giant has argued this would be a ""disproportionate"" step.Separately, Google is seeking to appeal a UK court decision in June to allow a £13.6bn collective-action lawsuit against it to proceed.The case alleges the search giant behaved in an anti-competitive way which caused online publishers in the UK to lose money.Google has vowed to oppose the claim ""vigorously and on the facts"".Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
Man accused of using bots and AI to earn streaming revenue,"A musician in the US has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) tools and thousands of bots to fraudulently stream songs billions of times in order to claim millions of dollars of royalties.Michael Smith, of North Carolina, has been charged with three counts of wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges.Prosecutors say it is the first criminal case of its kind they have handled.""Through his brazen fraud scheme, Smith stole millions in royalties that should have been paid to musicians, songwriters, and other rights holders whose songs were legitimately streamed,"" said US attorney Damian Williams.According to an unsealed indictment detailing the charges, the 52-year-old used hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs to manipulate streams.The tracks were streamed billions of times across multiple platforms by thousands of automated bot accounts to avoid detection.Authorities say Mr Smith claimed more than $10m in royalty payments over the course of the scheme, which spanned several years.What is AI and how does it work?Prosecutors said Mr Smith was set to finally ""face the music"" following their investigation, which also involved the FBI.""The FBI remains dedicated to plucking out those who manipulate advanced technology to receive illicit profits and infringe on the genuine artistic talent of others,"" said FBI acting assistant director Christie M. Curtis.
'Instant music ;)'
According to theindictment, Mr Smith was at points operating as many as 10,000 active bot accounts to stream his AI-generated tracks.It is alleged that the tracks in question were provided to Mr Smith through a partnership with the chief executive of an unnamed AI music company, who he turned to in or around 2018.The co-conspirator is said to have supplied him with thousands of tracks a month in exchange for track metadata, such as song and artist names, as well as a monthly cut of streaming revenue.""Keep in mind what we're doing musically here... this is not 'music,' it's 'instant music' ;),"" the executive wrote to Mr Smith in a March 2019 email, and disclosed in the indictment.Citing further emails obtained from Mr Smith and fellow participants in the scheme, the indictment also states the technology used to create the tracks improved over time - making the scheme harder for platforms to detect.In an email from February, Mr Smith claimed his ""existing music has generated at this point over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019.""Mr Smith faces decades in prison if found guilty of the charges.Earlier this year a man in Denmark was reportedly handed an 18-month sentence after being found guilty offraudulently profiting from music streaming royalties.Music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube generally forbid users from artificially inflating their number of streams to gain royalties and have taken steps to clamp down on or advised users on how to avoid the practice.Underchanges to its royalties policiesthat took effect in April, Spotify said it would charge labels and distributors per track if it detected artificial streams of their material.It also increased the number of streams a track needs in a 12 month period before royalties can be paid, and extended the minimum track length for noise recordings like white noise tracks.
Wider concerns
The wider rise of AI-generated music, and the increased availability of free tools to make tracks, have added to concerns for artists and record labels about getting their fair share of profits made on AI-created tracks.Tools that can create text, images, video, audio in response to prompts are underpinned by systems that have been ""trained"" on vast quantities of data, such as online text and images scraped, often indiscriminately, from across the web.Content that belongs to artists or is protected by copyright has been swept up to form part of some of the training data for such tools.This has sparked outrage for artists across creative industries who feel their work is being used to generate seemingly novel material without due recognition or reward.Platforms rushed to removea track that cloned the voices of Drake and The Weekndin 2023 after it went viral and made its way onto streaming services.Earlier this year, artists including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith signed an open lettercalling for the end to the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry."
'These aren't just words': The woman threatened for taking X to court,"Australia's internet watchdog says she received ""death threats"" and that her children were doxxed after she was targeted by Elon Musk for attempting to regulate his social media platform.Earlier this year, the eSafety commissioner took X to court over its refusal to remove videos of a religiously motivatedSydney church stabbingfor its global users.The case was ultimately dropped,but commissioner Julie Inman Grant says she received an ""avalanche of online abuse"" after Mr Musk called her the ""censorship commissar"" in a post to his 196 million followers.X did not immediately respond for comment when contacted, and the BBC was unable to reach Mr Musk directly.
Doxxing refers to the release of private information about individuals online, usually with malicious intent.On Friday,a Columbia University reportinto technology-facilitated gender-based violence - which used Ms Inman Grant as a case study - found that she had been mentioned in almost 74,000 posts on X ahead of the court proceedings, despite being a relatively unknown figure online beforehand.According to the analysis, the majority of the messages were either negative, hateful or threatening in some way. Dehumanising slurs and gendered language were also frequently noted, with users calling Ms Inman Grant names such as ""left-wing Barbie"", or ""captain tampon"".Speaking to the BBC, Ms Inman Grant said that Mr Musk's decision to use ""disinformation"" to suggest that she was ""trying to globally censor the internet"" had amounted to a ""dog whistle from a very powerful tech billionaire who owns his own megaphone"".She said that the torrent of online vitriol which followed had prompted Australian police to warn her against travelling to the US, and that the names of her children and other family members had been released across the internet.""There have been threats to my employees, my family, threats to my safety - including credible death threats. I've had to involve the federal and local police and change my movements,"" she said.""These aren't just mean words where there’s a lack of resilience, these are threats of harm that can very easily spill over into real world violence.""Australia's independent internet regulator has a broad remit under local law to police content online that it deems to be violent or sexually exploitative.And when X refused to take down videos of the Wakeley attack - opting instead to geoblock the content from its Australian users - the commissioner sought and won a court injunction, forcing the company to temporarily comply.The case turned into a test of Australia's ability to enforce its online rules against social media giants operating in multiple jurisdictions – one which failed after a Federal Court judge found that banning the posts from appearing on X globally would not be “reasonable” as it would likely be ""ignored or disparaged by other countries"".In June, Ms Inman Grant's office said it would not pursue the case further, and that it would focus on other pending litigation against the platform.X's Global Government Affairs team described the outcome as a win for ""freedom of speech""."
Crash dummies and robot arms: How airline seats are tested,"In a warehouse building in a quiet town in Northern Ireland, a robot arm is opening and closing an airplane meal table over and over again.It has been programmed to carry out this mundane task no fewer than 28,000 times, day and night, for more than a week. And it won’t even get a bag of peanuts.“We can measure the force that the robot’s having to apply to that,” says Gerald King, head of engineering at Thompson Aero Seating in Banbridge. “Is it increasing? Which means more friction.”Thompson makes first class and business class seats – the expensive kind usually at the front of passenger aircraft, with their own privacy-simulating enclosures, built-in entertainment systems, and heaps of leg room.The company has various machines for testing the longevity and safety of such seats. Including a new £7.5m facility, opened last autumn, where crash test dummies are strapped to a seat and shot down a short track at incredible speeds.The idea is to ensure that the seat – and passenger – would survive a brief exposure to 16 g’s. It is the only facility of its kind on the island of Ireland.
Perhaps surprisingly, just under one third of the world’s aircraft seats are manufactured in Northern Ireland, according to Invest NI, an economic development agency. Thompson, which was bought by a Chinese company in 2016, is one of a few businesses in the region that specialise in this trade. The firm currently churns out roughly 1,500 seats per year.Another major Northern Ireland-based supplier of seats is Collins Aerospace, in Kilkeel. There is also Alice Blue Aero, in Craigavon.One of the largest seat manufacturing companies worldwide is Safran. It has facilities on six continents.But, thanks to the pandemic, demand for aircraft seats has flip-flopped dramatically of late. When Covid-19 emerged, the aerospace manufacturing industry slowed to a crawl. Globally, companies laid off thousands of workers. Thompson, for one, cut its own workforce in half, and has faced financial losses running to many millions.The world has at last opened up again, but seat manufacturers have not been able to find all the skilled workers they need, meaning that demand, globally speaking, is outstripping supply. It is a “very difficult situation”, Airbus’ chief executive said in June, referring to the slow supply of seats and other cabin parts.“The industry lost that expertise, both in terms of direct, hands-on manufacturing, but also in terms of teaching younger people how to do the job,” explains Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners who tracks the fortunes of another seat maker, Safran.One of the problems, he adds, is that seat makers are finding it hard to get their seats tested and certified quickly by third-parties, since they are also facing labour shortages.
Thompson, however, can sidestep this problem with its in-house testing facilities, explains Colm McEvoy, vice president of corporate accounts. He says that the firm is able to meet its customers’ needs at present, though he adds, “We’re having to be very strategic with regards to the new customers.”There are more than 650 people working at Thompson’s sites in Northern Ireland, but, at the time of writing, the company had more than a dozen job vacancies listed on its website. “We’re in competition with other manufacturing companies to try and secure the best talent,” says Mr McEvoy.Despite this challenge, Thompson has a five-year plan to multiply its annual output of seats. Mr McEvoy shows me around the factory floor at the firm’s Portadown site, where workers are busy riveting aluminium seat parts together, and checking the complex wiring for the entertainment systems in these expensive structures – each seat costs “tens of thousands” to make, says Mr McEvoy.“This seat in front of you is the most complex seat we make,” adds Eoin Murray, operations manager. It takes around 100 hours for the highly skilled workers here to assemble in full.
Mr Murray is determined to boost the rate of production on this factory floor. He shows off a jig, developed in-house, upon which a seat can be mounted and angled so that workers can easily access the sides or underside. “This allows us to hit like a rate 14,” says Mr Murray – 14 seats produced in one shift. “I need to get to 18. To 20,” he adds.To that end, there’s another even more capable version of the jig in the room next door, a prototype that staff here hope will be even better. Mr Murray and his colleagues are also developing new working practices – such as utility belts with tools arranged in the sequence they are required.If the worker is left-handed, that sequence can be reversed so that the process of picking a tool and carrying out a task with it is as rapid as possible.Workers here rehearse and hone key stages of seat assembly, which helps them go faster. A bit like learning how to build the same piece of Ikea furniture over and over again until it becomes like muscle memory, I suggest – just a lot more complicated.“We can seamlessly slot people in, and they can now work through these different stages with no computers,” says Mr Murray. “When I started working here, if you told me I would be working without a computer I’d have told you [that] you were crazy.”
Besides volume, there is constant pressure to come up with new and better seat designs, says Mr McEvoy. Airlines want the latest and best entertainment technology, for example – 32 inch screens are now included in Thompson’s top seats.“They’re striving for something different, something that makes them unique,” Mr McEvoy adds. Thompson uses leather and soft fabrics on selected parts of the seat and enclosure to provide a luxury feel, which is increasingly popular with airlines. The seats themselves can recline into two-metre long, fully flat beds.One I try for myself is certainly comfortable – though I would probably have to lie in it for seven hours or so to test it properly, I think to myself.“They’re good firms, very, very good firms – they know what they’re doing,” says Marisa Garcia, an aviation industry analyst who used to work in seat manufacturing herself, referring to the Northern Ireland-based companies who make aircraft seats. She has no commercial relationship with any of them, she adds.Despite supply chain headaches, seat manufacturers are in a good position to clean up, if they prove themselves able to keep pace with industry requirements, says Ms Garcia: “The demand is there from passengers – and the demand is there from airlines.”"
Trump says Musk could head 'government efficiency' force,"Donald Trump said he would enlist Elon Musk to run a “government efficiency commission” if he wins a second term as US president.Speaking to the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Trump said the X owner had agreed to head a task force to conduct a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government” and make “recommendations for drastic reforms.”The two men have alluded to the idea for several weeks, but Thursday's comments were Trump’s most direct indication yet that he might want Mr Musk to play a role in his potential second administration.“I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,” Mr Musk posted on X on Thursday morning. “No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.”Asked by the BBC if Trump and Mr Musk had formally agreed on a role on such a commission, campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes said that ""It is premature to discuss any prospective personnel in the next administration, but we welcome the enthusiasm and support of Elon Musk.”The two have not always seen eye-to-eye,but Mr Musk and Trump have recently forged a friendlier public relationship during the 2024 US presidential election.The controversial tech billionaire endorsed the former president in July, after Trump was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania, and has said he is contributing money to a fundraising group that supports the Republican's campaign.“I think we need a government efficiency commission to say like, ‘Hey, where are we spending money that’s sensible. Where is it not sensible?’” Mr Musk said during an online conversation with Trump on 13 August,which he hosted on X.“We need to live within our means.”A few days later, on 19 August, Mr Musk posted an apparently AI-generated image of himself at a podium labelled ""Department of Government Efficiency” and declared in the caption, ""I am willing to serve"".Some internet users appreciated the hypothetical agency name as a joke, as the initials for the proposed task force spell ""doge"" – a long-running meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog which also inspired the name of a cryptocurrency.
Trump's New York speech
But Trump has indicated he is serious about working with the outspoken SpaceX and Tesla boss should he retake the White House in November.“When Elon started the conversation with the president, I think the president was very excited that somebody like Elon Musk is so dedicated to America’s future that he would be willing to be a part of something to help the government work more efficiently,” Mr Hughes told reporters on Thursday, according to CNBC.The former president made his announcement in New York before a high-profile, members-only group of business leaders.Founded in 1907, the Economics Club of New York has hosted speeches from figures such as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Trump last addressed the group in 2019, where he received a warm reception.The former president mostly focused on the economy.He repeated calls to cut taxes and regulation, open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and said he would raise tariffs to promote US manufacturing – at one point promising to restore auto industry employment to its peak decades ago.He also proposed an especially low tax rate of 15% for companies that make products in the US, in contrast to the 20% general rate he proposed for companies. His opponent Kamala Harris has suggested a 28% rate.Trump brushed off concerns that tax cuts might worsen the US budget deficit, saying the US would “make our money back on growth” and proposed creating a national investment fund with money collected from tariffs.The audience was largely quiet, though many attendees clapped when Trump discussed Mr Musk’s endorsement.During a question-and-answer session, Trump was asked if he would roll back sanctions to Russia, which he did not specifically address.He did say, however, that he believes the Biden administration has used the tool too widely in general.Trump said he prefers to use sanctions for short periods and “as little as possible”, so that countries are not encouraged to seek out international alternatives to the US financial system and the dollar."
Microsoft is turning to AI to make its workplace more inclusive,"Microsoft's chief diversity officer says diversity and investment in the workforce can help fix AI's bias problems.
At the beginning of 2023, Microsoft found itself in a PR firestorm. The company was working to demonstrate its progress in artificial intelligence following amulti-billion dollar investmentin OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. It added an AI powered chatbot into its Bing search engine, which placed it among the first legacy tech companies to fold AI into its flagship products, but almost as soon as people started using it, things went sideways.
A New York Times journalist sparked international intrigue over aconversation he had with Bingthat left him ""deeply unsettled"". Soon, users began sharing screenshots that appeared to show the toolusing racial slursand announcing plans for world domination. Microsoft quickly announced a fix, limiting the AI's responses and capabilities. In the following months, the company replaced its Bing chatbot with Copilot, which is now available as part of its Microsoft 365 software and Windows operating system.
Microsoft is far from the only company to face AI controversy, and critics say the debacle is evidence of broader carelessness around the dangers of artificial intelligence within the tech industry. For example, Google's Bard tool famouslyanswereda question about a telescope inaccurately during a live press demo, a mistake that wiped $100bn (£82bn) off the company's value. The AI model, now called Gemini, latercame under fire for ""woke"" biasafter the tool seemed unwilling to produce images of white people for certain prompts.
Still, Microsoft says AI can be a tool to promote equity and representation – with the right safeguards. One solution it's putting forward to help address the issue of bias in AI is increasing diversity and inclusion of the teams building the technology itself.
""It's never been more important as we think about building inclusive AI and inclusive tech for the future,"" says Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft's chief diversity officer, who joined the firm in 2018.
A former teacher for the deaf, McIntyre has spent over 20 years in human resources in the tech industry, including at IBM, and has lived and worked throughout the US as well as in Singapore and Dubai. Now, she says her team at Microsoft is increasingly focused on embedding inclusion practices into the firm's AI research and development to make sure there is better representation ""at all levels of the company"".
There's good reason for this focus. Embracing AI products has brought new life to the nearly 50-year-old brand. In July, the company reported revenue for the year wasup 15% to $64.7 billion(£49.2 billion), due largely togrowth from its Azure cloud business,which has greatly benefited from the AI boom as customers train their systems on the platform.
The efforts also push the company closer to its long-time goal to build technology ""that understands us"", as its CEO Satya Nadellarecently put it. But in order for AI – or more specifically large-language models such as ChatGPT –to be empathic, relevant and accurate, McIntyre says, they needs to be trained by a more diverse group of developers, engineers and researchers.
This may not be a guaranteed fix. The large language models that underpin tools such as Copilot, ChatGPT and Gemini are built by scraping massive data sets from across the internet. If bias is present in the training data, it's exceedingly difficult to stop it from cropping up later, which is of particular concern as artificial intelligence is used out in the real world.
Companies are embracing tools to help with hiring, for example, but experts warn theycan reinforce race and gender biases as they filter candidates.Recent research from MIT found thatAI interpreted professionssuch as ""flight attendant"", ""secretary"", and ""physician's assistant"" as feminine jobs, while ""fisherman"", ""lawyer"", and ""judge"" were deemed masculine jobs. It also labelled emotions including ""anxious"", ""depressed"" and ""devastated"" as feminine. Meanwhile, some US police departments have begunusing AI towrite up crime reports.
Still, Microsoft believes that AI can support diversity and inclusion (D&I) if these ideals are built into AI models in the first place. The company maintains that inclusion has always been a large part of its culture, from the Xbox Adaptive Controller designed for users with special needs to the many accessibility features in its Microsoft 365 products. But the pressure to keep up with the pace and scale at which AI is growing is intensifying Microsoft's need to invest in its own diversity.
In its2023 diversity report, Microsoft reported about54.8% of its core workforceis made up of racial and ethnic minorities, which is in line in part to rivals such asAppleand Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft's workforce is 31.2% women, down a few percentage points compared to Apple and Google.
Below, McIntrye talks with the BBC about addressing biases in generative AI, how inclusive allyship looks across different cultures, and what Microsoft is doing to ensure its own talent can keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.
How is Microsoft addressing bias in generative AI that afflicts these types of tools?
We do a tremendous amount of investment [around this] but we also thread education on elements like bias and inclusion generally through all the work that we do.
Microsoft believes AI technologies should perform fairly. We are continuing to invest in research on identifying, measuring and mitigating different types of fairness-related harms, and we are innovating in new ways to proactively test our AI systems, as outlined in ourResponsible AI Standard. To do this, Microsoft works with a wide array of experts, including anthropologists, linguists and social scientists – all of whom bring valuable perspectives to the table that advance and challenge the thinking of our engineers and developers.
To develop and deploy AI systems responsibly, we are putting D&I at the centre by ensuring a wide range of backgrounds, skills and experiences are represented across the Microsoft teams that are envisioning and building AI so that it's developed in a way that's inclusive of all users. We also ensure our leaders who are making the decisions about these teams and products have the tools to understand issues of privilege, power and bias.
Microsoft received backlash this summer following headlines around cutting its diversity and inclusion team. The company laterclarifiedthe team remained intact. Has there been a change to the company's commitment here?
We are really fortunate Microsoft's commitment to diversity and inclusion is unwavering and unchanged. We're expanding. In that news cycle, I was reminded of how many people are depending on Microsoft to have inclusive tech, to make sure that we are continuing to stay on the forefront of the diversity and inclusion experiences, to share our learnings and to listen to how other people are experiencing this same moment in the industry. Not because we know more than anybody else – because for sure we don't, we're learning all the time – but we do have resources that not all companies have.

Are there any other focus areas when it comes to AI and inclusivity?
One that is pretty dynamic is [making AI accessible] in morelanguages.When you're operating in a language different from your primary language, your brain has to work harder and you're less productive and less able to be your true authentic self. There's a real ongoing opportunity in AI to be even more thoughtful and relevant on the totality of global language. It's an enormous task, but we’re learning so much every day and the AI is just getting smarter.
Beyond AI, we did a partnership with external organisations who support the LGBTQ+ communities and our own employee resource group aboutadding pronounsto user profiles in Microsoft 365. [This allows people] to feel seen, recognised and cared for in the technology, which is the experience we want them to have.
How do you help a workforce of 230,000 understand allyship when it looks different in various cultures?
We have a core strategy but also localise it. In India, for example, we just ran a D&I experience at the intersection of race, ethnicity and religion for managers and leaders. Through feedback, we were also able to have Copilot pop up with responses that are both qualitative and quantitative so that we can be more effective as we deploy it to the whole of the workforce.
We're also doing that in Australia and New Zealand for the indigenous communities. And in the Middle East and Africa, we wanted more support for employees and their families who are going through menopause – something that isn't always talked about in cultures around the world.
We also have to think about something as simple as the devices and the languages people are using, along with the accessibility features. Everyone wants an empathetic AI that is knowledgeable and relevant. We want to feel like the AI understands us and what we're trying to achieve. So, being able to have cultural context in the AI experience will result in a more satisfied experience – and those expectations that we put on the technology ultimately come from having a diverse workforce working on and building and creating the AI from the beginning.
How do you make sure talent doesn't get left behind as AI is evolving?
We have an incredible AI learning hub that allows us to access the latest and greatest learnings… and the employee resource group is doing upskilling, leveraging some of the content to even teach themselves. Whether they are an engineer or a field seller or a program manager, we offer AI [courses]to help make us more productive – even those of us in HR. We have a huge HR team that's focused on how to leverage AI for the HR experience at Microsoft.
How is Microsoft leveraging AI in HR?
For example, Copilot is helping us get back to employees with questions faster. We are also deploying AI skilling courses, so all employees have a shared understanding of AI technology as we use it more and more in our work across business areas.
For any organisation considering how to bring AI into HR work, there are three strategies to consider. First, form a community of learning with experts to build acumen together. Get curious with the technology, such as engaging with Copilot to learn how it can help you build inclusion in your organisation. And finally, ensure a human-centred design that puts empathy and people experience at the centre.

Nigerian brothers jailed in US for sextortion scam targeting teenagers,"Two brothers from Nigeria who targeted a 17-year-old in a sextortion scam have been sentenced to 17 years and six months in jail in the US.The Ogoshi brothers, from Lagos, lured Jordan DeMay into sending them explicit images by pretending to be a girl his age - then blackmailed him.He killed himself less than six hours after they started talking on Instagram.It is the first successful prosecution of Nigerians for sextortion in the US, where it is a rapidly growing cyber-crime, often linked to Nigeria.
Jordan's mother, Jenn Buta, held pictures of her son in court and wept as she read a victim impact statement. ""I am shattered to my core,"" she said.She welcomed the ending of the trial, but said there was no good outcome from the tragic case.Jordan DeMay was a popular schoolboy from Michigan.Samuel Ogoshi, 24, and Samson Ogoshi, 21, sent him a friend request on Instagram pretending to be a pretty girl his age and then flirted with him.Once they received explicit images from the teenager, they blackmailed him for hundreds of dollars, threatening to share the pictures online with his friends if he did not comply.Jordan sent as much money as he could and warned the scammers that he would kill himself if they spread the images.The criminals replied: “Good… Do that fast - or I'll make you do it.”John DeMay told Marquette federal court in Michigan he still has nightmares after finding his son dead in his bedroom. He said his family was forced to move home to escape the memory.If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action LineThe brotherspleaded guilty in Aprilto conspiring to sexually exploit teenage boys in Michigan and across the US.Thirty-eight other US victims were also identified as being targeted by the men. 13 of them were minors.The brothers sat in court in orange jumpsuits with handcuffs.Their defence attorneys said the brothers' crimes were fuelled by drug abuse and the sextortion scam culture in Nigeria.The judge said the crimes showed a ""callous disregard for life"", especially given they continued targeting other victims after learning that Jordan has died.Both brothers apologised to Jordan's family.""I'm sorry to the family. We made a bad decision to make money and I wish I could change that,"" Samson Ogoshi said.In the first case of its kind, US police tracked the criminals to Lagos last summer and successfully extradited them for trial.
Another Nigerian man linked to Jordan’s death and other cases is fighting extradition.
Speaking to the BBC in May from Jordan's family home in the city of Marquette, Jordan's mother praised the police for their work tracking the sextortionists down.But she said she had mixed feelings about the Ogoshis being behind bars.""It's a relief that someone is being held accountable, but there's no good that's coming out of this situation for my family or for the individuals responsible's family,"" she said.""I miss my son more than I can describe to you, but the mother of those men is probably missing her two sons as well now. She too is really just an innocent bystander of sextortion crime,"" said Jenn Buta.Researchers and law enforcement agencies point to Nigeria as a hotspot for this type of crime.In April, two Nigerian men were arrested after a schoolboy from Australia killed himself. Two other men are on trial in Lagos after the suicides of a 15-year-old boy in the US and a 14-year-old in Canada.Nigerian authorities are also working with police in Scotland to investigate the case of 16-year-old Murray Dowey, who killed himself in December.
In January, US cyber-company Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) highlighted a web of Nigerian TikTok, YouTube and Scribd accounts sharing tips and scripts for sextortion. Many of the discussions and videos are in Nigerian Pidgin dialect.Nigeria cyber-security professor Adedeji Oyenuga from Lagos State University says he hopes the news of Nigerians being sentenced will filter through to criminals and put them off.""The Ogoshis case has already sent a bad signal. I am hearing from street level that it is having an effect and it might not stop criminals turning to these crimes, but it will likely reduce the numbers,"" he said.There had been an increase in the number of local victims too and Professor Oyenuga says Nigerian police have had some success in tackling the criminals.
It is not the first time that some of Nigeria’s young, tech-savvy population has embraced a new wave of cyber-crime.The term ""Yahoo Boys"" is used to describe a portion of the population that use cyber-crime to earn a living. It comes from the early 2000s wave of Nigerian Prince scam emails which spread through the Yahoo email service.Dr Tombari Sibe, from cyber-security firm Digital Footprints Nigeria, says cyber-fraud such as sextortion has become normalised among young people in the country, but he hopes that news of the Ogoshis' sentencing spreads fast.""They see cybercrime as a bloodless crime, with potentially lucrative financial rewards. This case needs to be given sufficient coverage to show these young people that sextortion can lead to loss of life and long prison sentences,"" he said."
YouTube restricts teenager access to fitness videos,"YouTube is to limit recommendations of certain health and fitness videos to teenagers, including those which ""idealise"" certain body types.It says 13 to 17-year-old users will still be able to search for and view fitness-related content - but will not be encouraged into repeated viewing of similar videos.YouTube says it is acting because of concerns that repeated exposure to such material can lead young people to develop ""negative beliefs"" about themselves.Experts have welcome the measure but say it needs to be accompanied by a ""broader discussion"" about fitness and health for young people.YouTube's algorithm will usually recommend similar content for users to watch once they have finished a particular video, as well as displaying related videos on a sidebar.The platform says this will no longer be offered for teens when they view certain types of content, including:videos that compare physical features and idealises some types over othersvideos idealising specific fitness levels or body weightsvideos displaying social aggression in the form of non-contact fights and intimidationYouTube said the measures were being taken after its Youth and Familes Advisory Committee found that ""teens are more likely than adults to form negative beliefs about themselves when seeing repeated messages about ideal standards in content they consume online.""However, the restrictions on what videos are offered will only be possible if the user is logged in to a YouTube account - and if they have registered an accurate date of birth.The platform does not automatically verify new users who join it.However new users must be at least 13 years old, and if YouTube suspects they provided an inaccurate age, they may be asked to verify it.New users who fail that verification will be asked to add a parent or guardian to supervise the account – and failing to do this will result in the account being disabled.Dr Petya Eckler, a senior lecturer at University of Strathclyde who studies the relationship between body image and social media, said she welcomed the announcement given ""the link between use of social media by young people and perceptions of their bodies.""But she told the BBC more needed to be done.""This should go hand in hand with a broader discussion of fitness and health within families and the idea that exercise is a great way to enhance our overall health and wellbeing and should not be done only for appearance reasons.""
YouTube has also announced new ways for parents to keep track of their children’s activities on the platform.Parents will be able link their accounts with teenagers in their household in order to see their uploads, subscriptions and comments, and receive emails when they upload videos or start livestreams.In May,Ofcom told tech firms to reformulate their algorithmsto steer children away from what it called ""toxic"" material."
Phone companies asked to help tackle rise in thefts,"Phone companies are to be called into the Home Office to discuss measures to tackle crime after snatch thefts more than doubled in England and Wales over the last year.Government figures indicate that, in the year to March, there were an estimated 78,000 thefts from the person - defined as items such as phones, bags and wallets being taken without force being used or threatened.The figure for the previous year was 31,000.Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson said the government wanted manufacturers to ensure that any stolen phone could be permanently disabled to prevent it being sold second-hand.Police chiefs will also be tasked with gathering more intelligence on who is stealing phones and where stolen devices end up.A growing demand for second-hand phones, both in the UK and abroad, is believed to be a major driver behind the recent rise in thefts, the government said.The Home Office is to host a summit at which tech companies and phone manufacturers will be asked to consider innovations that could help stop phones being traded illegally.The government said it hoped to build on anti-theft features already introduced to smartphones.Dame Diana said the government hoped to ""break the business model"" of the people organising the thefts.“Phone companies must ensure that any stolen phones can be quickly, easily and permanently disabled, rather than re-registered for sale on the second-hand market, and we will be meeting them soon to discuss what further action is required to make that happen.""
At present, the prosecution rate for thefts from the person is very low.Of the 78,000 such theftsthe Crime Survey for England and Walesestimates occurred, only 0.8% resulted in a person being charged.Almost 82% of investigations were closed without the police finding a suspect.The efforts to tackle thefts will also include continued patrol surges in areas around the country most at risk of serious violence, including knifepoint robberies.Commander Richard Smith of the National Police Chiefs' Council said forces continued to"" target those habitual criminals responsible for prolific offending"".""However, we know that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem,"" he said. ""Manufacturers and the tech industry have an important role in reducing opportunities for criminals to benefit from the re-sale of stolen handsets.”
What to do if your phone is stolen
If your phone is stolen, you should contact the police and provide them your IMEI number - a 15-digit code unique to your device. It is also likely you will need this for an insurance claim.It will be often be printed on the label on your device's box, and most mobile providers can give you this information if you contact them.You can also get this information ahead of any incidents by dialling *#06# on your phone, and many modern operating systems include this information in the settings menu.You should tell your network provider, so they can cancel your Sim card and prevent thieves using your device.While it may not be the first thing that comes to mind, you should also let your bank know - so thieves can't use your mobile banking app. While this is less common, thieves sometimes target people by watching them login to online banking to glean their password, before stealing their device.If you use two-factor authentication, you should remove your phone as a trusted device, and you might consider changing your email passwords too.But it's worth remembering that while this is all good practice to keep your data safe, in the vast majority of cases thieves are more interested in selling your device for profit on the second-hand market, rather than accessing your data.
Disabling devices
Both iPhone and Android devices have protections against theft.On an iPhone you can use ""Find My iPhone"" to locate your device, providing you have turned it on before it was lost or stolen. You can then login to iCloud on a computer and track your phone.  If it has been stolen, you can secure it and erase all your data.Meanwhile Android has ""Find My Device"" which operates similarly, allowing you to lock your phone and erase your data remotely. Samsung users have a similar tool called ""SmartThings Find"".In these lost modes, Android and iPhone devices cannot be easily unlocked and used again, but thieves are always looking for new ways to bypass these protections.Android 10+ users worldwide will soon receive a feature called Theft Detection Lock, which will use Google's AI to figure out if your phone has been stolen - and lock the device down.It does this by recognising how a phone moves and shakes if it's been snatched out of somebody's hand and speedily taken away.Such a device can still be unlocked if someone knows the phone's PIN or password, while if it triggers by accident it can be unlocked by fingerprint or face scan as normal.Google is also rolling out an upgrade to how a phone is reset to factory settings, to make it so a device can only be set up again by using the device's password.The government wants phone companies to make sure that stolen devices cannot be resold on the second-hand market.Network operators blacklist the IMEI of devices which are reported stolen, meaning they generally speaking cannot be resold in the UK.Because of this, thieves will often send stolen devices overseas to be resold in other countries where the IMEI has not been blocked.Stopping this would require some kind of truly permanent lock to make a device completely unusable for good after it's reported stolen - presumably involving phone companies making it so a device cannot even be turned on once it's reported stolen."
Inside the deepfake porn crisis engulfing Korean schools,"Last Saturday, a Telegram message popped up on Heejin’s phone from an anonymous sender. “Your pictures and personal information have been leaked. Let’s discuss.”As the university student entered the chatroom to read the message, she received a photo of herself taken a few years ago while she was still at school. It was followed by a second image using the same photo, only this one was sexually explicit, and fake.Terrified, Heejin, which is not her real name, did not respond, but the images kept coming. In all of them, her face had been attached to a body engaged in a sex act, using sophisticated deepfake technology.Deepfakes, the majority of which combine a real person’s face with a fake, sexually explicit body, are increasingly being generated using artificial intelligence.“I was petrified, I felt so alone,” Heejin told the BBC.But she was not alone.Two days earlier, South Korean journalist Ko Narin had published what would turn into the biggest scoop of her career. It had recently emerged that police were investigating deepfake porn rings at two of the country’s major universities, and Ms Ko was convinced there must be more.She started searching social media and uncovered dozens of chat groups on the messaging app Telegram where users were sharing photos of women they knew and using AI software to convert them into fake pornographic images within seconds.“Every minute people were uploading photos of girls they knew and asking them to be turned into deepfakes,” Ms Ko told us.Ms Ko discovered these groups were not just targeting university students. There were rooms dedicated to specific high schools and even middle schools. If a lot of content was created using images of a particular student, she might even be given her own room. Broadly labelled “humiliation rooms” or “friend of friend rooms”, they often come with strict entry terms.Ms Ko’s report in the Hankyoreh newspaper has shocked South Korea. On Monday, police announced they were considering opening an investigation into Telegram, following the lead of authorities in France, who recently charged Telegram’s Russian founder for crimes relating to the app. The government has vowed to bring in stricter punishments for those involved, and the president has called for young men to be better educated.Telegram said it ""actively combats harmful content on its platform, including illegal pornography,"" in a statement provided to the BBC.
'A systematic and organised process'
The BBC has viewed the descriptions of a number of these chatrooms. One calls for members to post more than four photos of someone along with their name, age and the area they live in.“I was shocked at how systematic and organised the process was,” said Ms Ko. “The most horrific thing I discovered was a group for underage pupils at one school that had more than 2,000 members.”In the days after Ms Ko’s article was published, women’s rights activists started to scour Telegram too, and follow leads.By the end of that week, more than 500 schools and universities had been identified as targets. The actual number impacted is still to be established, but many are believed to be aged under 16, which is South Korea's age of consent. A large proportion of the suspected perpetrators are teenagers themselves.Heejin said learning about the scale of the crisis had made her anxiety worse, as she now worried how many people might have viewed her deepfakes. Initially she blamed herself. “I couldn’t stop thinking did this happen because I uploaded my photos to social media, should I have been more careful?”Scores of women and teenagers across the country have since removed their photos from social media or deactivated their accounts altogether, frightened they could be exploited next.“We are frustrated and angry that we are having to censor our behaviour and our use of social media when we have done nothing wrong,” said one university student, Ah-eun, whose peers have been targeted.Ah-eun said one victim at her university was told by police not to bother pursuing her case as it would be too difficult to catch the perpetrator, and it was “not really a crime” as “the photos were fake”.
At the heart of this scandal is the messaging app Telegram. The app is known for having a ‘light touch’ moderation stance and has been accused of not doing enough to police content and particularly groups for years.This has made it aprime space for criminal behaviour to flourish.Last week, politicians and the police responded forcefully, promising to investigate these crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.On Monday, Seoul National Police Agency announced it would look to investigate Telegram over its role in enabling fake pornographic images of children to be distributed.South Korea faces deepfake porn 'emergency'South Korean women protest in Seoul over hidden sex camerasThe app’s founder, Pavel Durov, wascharged in France last weekwith being complicit in a number of crimes related to the app, including enabling the sharing of child pornography.But women's rights activists accuse the authorities in South Korea of allowing sexual abuse on Telegram to simmer unchecked for too long, because Korea has faced this crisis before. In 2019, it emerged that a sex ring was using Telegram to coerce women and children into creating and sharing sexually explicit images of themselves.Police at the time asked Telegram for help with their investigation, but the app ignored all seven of their requests. Although the ringleader was eventually sentenced to more than 40 years in jail, no action was taken against the platform, because of fears around censorship.“They sentenced the main actors but otherwise neglected the situation, and I think this has exacerbated the situation,” said Ms Ko.
Park Jihyun, who, as a young student journalist, uncovered the Nth room sex-ring back in 2019, has since become a political advocate for victims of digital sex crimes. She said that since the deepfake scandal broke, pupils and parents had been calling her several times a day crying.“They have seen their school on the list shared on social media and are terrified.”Ms Park has been leading calls for the government to regulate or even ban the app in South Korea. “If these tech companies will not cooperate with law enforcement agencies, then the state must regulate them to protect its citizens,” she said.Before this latest crisis exploded, South Korea’s Advocacy Centre for Online Sexual Abuse victims (ACOSAV) was already noticing a sharp uptick in the number of underage victims of deepfake pornography.In 2023 they counselled 86 teenage victims. That jumped to 238 in just the first eight months of this year. In the past week alone, another 64 teen victims have come forward.One of the centre’s leaders, Park Seonghye, said over the past week her staff had been inundated with calls and were working around the clock. “It’s been a full scale emergency for us, like a wartime situation,” she said.“With the latest deepfake technology there is now so much more footage than there used to be, and we’re worried it’s only going to increase.”As well as counselling victims, the centre tracks down harmful content and works with online platforms to have it taken down. Ms Park said there had been some instances where Telegram had removed content at their request. “So it’s not impossible,” she noted.In a statement, Telegram told the BBC that its moderators “proactively monitor public parts of the app, use AI tools and accept user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of content each day that breach Telegram's terms of service”.While women’s rights organisations accept that new AI technology is making it easier to exploit victims, they argue this is just the latest form of misogyny to play out online in South Korea.First women were subjected to waves of verbal abuse online. Then came the spy cam epidemic, where they were secretly filmed using public toilets and changing rooms.""The root cause of this is structural sexism and the solution is gender equality,” read a statement signed by 84 women’s groups.This is a direct criticism of the country’s President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has denied the existence of structural sexism, cut funding to victim support groups and is abolishing the government’s gender equality ministry.
Lee Myung-hwa, who treats young sex offenders, agreed that although the outbreak of deepfake abuse might seem sudden, it had long been lurking under the surface. “For teenagers, deepfakes have become part of their culture, they’re seen as a game or a prank,” said the counsellor, who runs the Aha Seoul Youth Cultural Centre.Ms Lee said it was paramount to educate young men, citing research that shows when you tell offenders exactly what they have done wrong, they become more aware of what counts as sexual abuse, which stops them from reoffending.Meanwhile, the government has said it will increase the criminal sentences of those who create and share deepfake images, and will also punish those who view the pornography.It follows criticism that not enough perpetrators were being punished. One of the issues is that the majority of offenders are teenagers, who are typically tried in youth courts, where they receive more lenient sentences.Since the chatrooms were exposed, many have been closed down, but new ones will almost certainly take their place. A humiliation room has already been created to target the journalists covering this story. Ms Ko, who broke the news, said this had given her sleepless nights. “I keep checking the room to see if my photo has been uploaded,” she said.Such anxiety has spread to almost every teenage girl and young woman in South Korea. Ah-eun, the university student, said it had made her suspicious of her male acquaintances.“I now can’t be certain people won’t commit these crimes behind my back, without me knowing,” she said. “I’ve become hyper-vigilant in all my interactions with people, which can’t be good.”Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Suhnwook Lee"
'It stains your brain': How social media algorithms show violence to boys,"It was 2022 and Cai, then 16, was scrolling on his phone. He says one of the first videos he saw on his social media feeds was of a cute dog. But then, it all took a turn.He says “out of nowhere” he was recommended videos of someone being hit by a car, a monologue from an influencer sharing misogynistic views, and clips of violent fights. He found himself asking - why me?Over in Dublin, Andrew Kaung was working as an analyst on user safety at TikTok, a role he held for 19 months from December 2020 to June 2022.He says he and a colleague decided to examine what users in the UK were being recommended by the app’s algorithms, including some 16-year-olds. Not long before, he had worked for rival company Meta, which owns Instagram - another of the sites Cai uses.When Andrew looked at the TikTok content, he was alarmed to find how some teenage boys were being shown posts featuring violence and pornography, and promoting misogynistic views, he tells BBC Panorama. He says, in general, teenage girls were recommended very different content based on their interests.TikTok and other social media companies use AI tools to remove the vast majority of harmful content and to flag other content for review by human moderators, regardless of the number of views they have had. But the AI tools cannot identify everything.Andrew Kaung says that during the time he worked at TikTok, all videos that were not removed or flagged to human moderators by AI - or reported by other users to moderators - would only then be reviewed again manually if they reached a certain threshold.He says at one point this was set to 10,000 views or more. He feared this meant some younger users were being exposed to harmful videos. Most major social media companies allow people aged 13 or above to sign up.TikTok says 99% of content it removes for violating its rules is taken down by AI or human moderators before it reaches 10,000 views. It also says it undertakes proactive investigations on videos with fewer than this number of views.
When he worked at Meta between 2019 and December 2020, Andrew Kaung says there was a different problem. He says that, while the majority of videos were removed or flagged to moderators by AI tools, the site relied on users to report other videos once they had already seen them.He says he raised concerns while at both companies, but was met mainly with inaction because, he says, of fears about the amount of work involved or the cost. He says subsequently some improvements were made at TikTok and Meta, but he says younger users, such as Cai, were left at risk in the meantime.Several former employees from the social media companies have told the BBC Andrew Kaung’s concerns were consistent with their own knowledge and experience.Algorithms from all the major social media companies have been recommending harmful content to children, even if unintentionally, UK regulator Ofcom tells the BBC.“Companies have been turning a blind eye and have been treating children as they treat adults,” says Almudena Lara, Ofcom's online safety policy development director.
'My friend needed a reality check'
TikTok told the BBC it has “industry-leading” safety settings for teens and employs more than 40,000 people working to keep users safe. It said this year alone it expects to invest “more than $2bn (£1.5bn) on safety”, and of the content it removes for breaking its rules it finds 98% proactively.Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it has more than 50 different tools, resources and features to give teens “positive and age-appropriate experiences”.Cai told the BBC he tried to use one of Instagram’s tools and a similar one on TikTok to say he was not interested in violent or misogynistic content - but he says he continued to be recommended it.He is interested in UFC - the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He also found himself watching videos from controversial influencers when they were sent his way, but he says he did not want to be recommended this more extreme content.“You get the picture in your head and you can't get it out. [It] stains your brain. And so you think about it for the rest of the day,” he says.Girls he knows who are the same age have been recommended videos about topics such as music and make-up rather than violence, he says.
Meanwhile Cai, now 18, says he is still being pushed violent and misogynistic content on both Instagram and TikTok.When we scroll through his Instagram Reels, they include an image making light of domestic violence. It shows two characters side by side, one of whom has bruises, with the caption: “My Love Language”. Another shows a person being run over by a lorry.Cai says he has noticed that videos with millions of likes can be persuasive to other young men his age.For example, he says one of his friends became drawn into content from a controversial influencer - and started to adopt misogynistic views.His friend “took it too far”, Cai says. “He started saying things about women. It’s like you have to give your friend a reality check.”Cai says he has commented on posts to say that he doesn’t like them, and when he has accidentally liked videos, he has tried to undo it, hoping it will reset the algorithms. But he says he has ended up with more videos taking over his feeds.
So, how do TikTok’s algorithms actually work?According to Andrew Kaung, the algorithms' fuel is engagement, regardless of whether the engagement is positive or negative. That could explain in part why Cai’s efforts to manipulate the algorithms weren’t working.The first step for users is to specify some likes and interests when they sign up. Andrew says some of the content initially served up by the algorithms to, say, a 16-year-old, is based on the preferences they give and the preferences of other users of a similar age in a similar location.According to TikTok, the algorithms are not informed by a user’s gender. But Andrew says the interests teenagers express when they sign up often have the effect of dividing them up along gender lines.The former TikTok employee says some 16-year-old boys could be exposed to violent content “right away”, because other teenage users with similar preferences have expressed an interest in this type of content - even if that just means spending more time on a video that grabs their attention for that little bit longer.The interests indicated by many teenage girls in profiles he examined - “pop singers, songs, make-up” - meant they were not recommended this violent content, he says.He says the algorithms use “reinforcement learning” - a method where AI systems learn by trial and error - and train themselves to detect behaviour towards different videos.Andrew Kaung says they are designed to maximise engagement by showing you videos they expect you to spend longer watching, comment on, or like - all to keep you coming back for more.The algorithm recommending content to TikTok's “For You Page”, he says, does not always differentiate between harmful and non-harmful content.According to Andrew, one of the problems he identified when he worked at TikTok was that the teams involved in training and coding that algorithm did not always know the exact nature of the videos it was recommending.“They see the number of viewers, the age, the trend, that sort of very abstract data. They wouldn't necessarily be actually exposed to the content,” the former TikTok analyst tells me.That was why, in 2022, he and a colleague decided to take a look at what kinds of videos were being recommended to a range of users, including some 16-year-olds.He says they were concerned about violent and harmful content being served to some teenagers, and proposed to TikTok that it should update its moderation system.They wanted TikTok to clearly label videos so everyone working there could see why they were harmful - extreme violence, abuse, pornography and so on - and to hire more moderators who specialised in these different areas. Andrew says their suggestions were rejected at that time.TikTok says it had specialist moderators at the time and, as the platform has grown, it has continued to hire more. It also said it separated out different types of harmful content - into what it calls queues - for moderators.
Panorama: Can We Live Without Our Phones?What happens when smartphones are taken away from kids for a week? With the help of two families and lots of remote cameras, Panorama finds out. And with calls for smartphones to be banned for children, Marianna Spring speaks to parents, teenagers and social media company insiders to investigate whether the content pushed to their feeds is harming them.Watch on Monday on BBC One at 20:00 BST (20:30 in Scotland) oron BBC iPlayer(UK only)
'Asking a tiger not to eat you'
Andrew Kaung says that from the inside of TikTok and Meta it felt really difficult to make the changes he thought were necessary.“We are asking a private company whose interest is to promote their products to moderate themselves, which is like asking a tiger not to eat you,” he says.He also says he thinks children’s and teenagers’ lives would be better if they stopped using their smartphones.But for Cai, banning phones or social media for teenagers is not the solution. His phone is integral to his life - a really important way of chatting to friends, navigating when he is out and about, and paying for stuff.Instead, he wants the social media companies to listen more to what teenagers don’t want to see. He wants the firms to make the tools that let users indicate their preferences more effective.“I feel like social media companies don't respect your opinion, as long as it makes them money,” Cai tells me.In the UK, a new law will force social media firms to verify children’s ages and stop the sites recommending porn or other harmful content to young people. UK media regulator Ofcom is in charge of enforcing it.
Almudena Lara, Ofcom's online safety policy development director, says that while harmful content that predominantly affects young women - such as videos promoting eating disorders and self-harm - have rightly been in the spotlight, the algorithmic pathways driving hate and violence to mainly teenage boys and young men have received less attention.“It tends to be a minority of [children] that get exposed to the most harmful content. But we know, however, that once you are exposed to that harmful content, it becomes unavoidable,” says Ms Lara.Ofcom says it can fine companies and could bring criminal prosecutions if they do not do enough, but the measures will not come in to force until 2025.TikTok says it uses “innovative technology” and provides “industry-leading” safety and privacy settings for teens, including systems to block content that may not be suitable, and that it does not allow extreme violence or misogyny.Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it has more than “50 different tools, resources and features” to give teens “positive and age-appropriate experiences”. According to Meta, it seeks feedback from its own teams and potential policy changes go through robust process."
'A tech firm stole our voices - then cloned and sold them',"The notion that artificial intelligence could one day take our jobs is a message many of us will have heard in recent years.But, for Paul Skye Lehrman, that warning has been particularly personal, chilling and unexpected: he heard his own voice deliver it.In June 2023, Paul and his partner Linnea Sage were driving near their home in New York City, listening to a podcast about the ongoing strikes in Hollywood and how artificial intelligence (AI) could affect the industry.The episode was of interest because the couple are voice-over performers and - like many other creatives - fear that human-sounding voice generators could soon be used to replace them.This particular podcast had a unique hook – they interviewed an AI-powered chat bot, equipped with text-to-speech software, to ask how it thought the use of AI would affect jobs in Hollywood.But, when it spoke, it sounded just like Mr Lehrman.""We needed to pull the car over,"" he said.""The irony that AI is coming for the entertainment industry, and here is my voice talking about the potential destruction of the industry, was really quite shocking.""That night they spent hours online, searching for clues until they came across the site of text-to-speech platform Lovo. Once there, Ms Sage said she found a copy of her voice as well.""I was stunned,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it.""""A tech company stole our voices, made AI clones of them, and sold them possibly hundreds of thousands of times.""They have now filed a lawsuit against Lovo. The firm has not yet responded to that or the BBC's requests for comment.
Clone wars
But how was Lovo able to recreate their voices? The couple alleges it was done under false pretences.Lovo co-founder Tom Lee has previously said its voice-cloning software only needs a user to read about 50 sentences to create a faithful clone.""We can capture the tone, the character, the style, the phonemes, and even if you have an accent, we can capture that as well,"" he told the Future Visionaries podcast in 2021.In their lawsuit, the couple set out how they say Lovo obtained just such a recording from them.They allege anonymous Lovo employees contacted them to record audio assets on Fiverr, the popular freelance talent website, where they were selling their services to provide audio for television, radio, video games, and other media.First, in 2019, Ms Sage says a user reached out asking for her to record dozens of generic sounding test radio scripts.Test recordings are often used in film and television for focus groups, internal meetings, or as placeholders for works in progress. Because they won’t be shared broadly, these recordings cost much less than audio meant for broadcast.Ms Sage says she completed the job, delivered the files, and was paid $400 (£303).About six months later, Mr Lehrman says he got a similar request to record dozens of generic sounding radio ads.
In messages the couple have shared with the BBC, the anonymous Fiverr user says the audio will be used for research into ""speech synthesis"".After asking the user to guarantee that the scripts will not be used outside their specific research project, Mr Lehrman asks what the goal of the project is.""The scripts will not be used for anything else,"" the user says, ""and I can't yet tell you the goal, as it's a confidential work in process sorry haha"".Mr Lehrman asked if the finished files would be repurposed or used in a different order. The user says the files will be used for research purposes only. Mr Lehrman says he delivered the files and was paid $1200.The link between the anonymous user and Lovo came, they say, from Lovo itself.They shared the evidence they had found of their voices being cloned with Lovo - who replied they had done nothing wrong, pointing to the communications between them the anonymous user as evidence they engaged with the couple legally.“In our careers, we've delivered over 100,000 audio assets,” Mr Lehrman said, of their work on Fiverr over the better part of a decade.“We were able to find this needle in a haystack - they gave us this needle in a haystack.”In both cases, both Mr Lehrman and Ms Sage say they did not have a written contract, just these conversations. The BBC has not been able to verify the entirety of their conversations. The couple say the user they spoke with also appears to have deleted some messages.The BBC contacted Lovo on several occasions to request an interview with Mr Lee and to seek a response to the couple’s claims. They did not respond to any of our messages.
What does the law say?
The lawsuit the couple filed in May alleges that Lovo used recordings of their voices to create copies that illegally compete with Ms Sage and Mr Lehrman’s real voices.The couple say the company did so without permission or proper compensation.It is a class action lawsuit - meaning they are hoping other claimants will join it, though none have so far.Professor Kristelia Garcia, an expert in intellectual property law at Georgetown University in Washington DC says the case is likely to centre on an area of US law called rights of publicity.Sometimes referred to as personality rights, violations of one’s publicity often come from misuse or misrepresentation of someone’s image or voice.She also says there could likely be a breach of contract regarding the licences Ms Sage and Mr Lehrman granted the user who commissioned the recordings.""Licences are permission for a very specific and narrow use. I might give you a licence to use my swimming pool one afternoon, but that doesn’t mean you can come whenever you want and have a party in my swimming pool,"" she told the BBC.""That would exceed the terms of the licence.""Whatever the outcome of the case, it is another in a long list of lawsuits brought by artists, authors, illustrators, and musicians who don't want to lose control of their work and livelihood.And they are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg. This week the financial firm Klarna said itplanned to use AI to halve its workforce.Some experts predict40% of all jobswill eventually be impacted by AIFor Mr Lehrman and Ms Sage though that worrying future is playing out now.""This whole experience has felt so surreal,"" Ms Sage said.""When we thought about artificial intelligence, we were thinking of AI folding our laundry and making us dinner, not pursuing human being’s creative endeavours.""You can hear more on this story onTech Life, on BBC Sounds."
Telegram: 'The dark web in your pocket',"About nine months ago while researching a story, I found myself added to a large Telegram channel which was focused on selling drugs.I was then added to one about hacking and then one about stolen credit cards.I realised my Telegram settings had made it possible for people to add me to their channels without me doing anything. I kept the settings the same to see what would happen.Within a few months, I had been added to 82 different groups.
I changed my settings to stop it, but now every time I log on I am treated to thousands of new messages across dozens of extremely active illegal groups.Thearrest of Telegram’s billionaire chief executivein France has ignited a debate about moderation on his app.Pavel Durov has been charged for suspected complicity in allowing illicit transactions, drug trafficking, fraud and the spread of child sex abuse images to flourish on his site.There is no doubt that criminality is happening on other social networks too, but my experiment hints at a broader problem that many in law enforcement have been concerned about for years.Here is a flavour of some of the groups to which I have found myself added.All the images were posted to the groups, and we have altered the names of the channels so as not to advertise them.
It is no wonder some people, like cyber-security podcaster Patrick Gray, have been describing Telegram for months as “the dark web in your pocket”.The dark web is a part of the internet that can only be accessed using specialist software and knowledge. Ever since the launch of the Silk Road marketplace in 2011, there has been a steady conveyor belt of websites selling illegal goods and services.Speaking about the shock arrest of Mr Durov, Mr Gray said on his podcast Risky Business that Telegram has been a haven for crime for a long time.“We are talking about child sexual abuse material, we’re talking about drug sales, we’re talking about absolutely dark web levels of criminality that they’re just doing nothing about,” he said.
Criminals like the dark web because of the anonymity it provides - internet traffic is bounced around the world, obscuring people's locations. Pinpointing who is behind certain usernames is extremely challenging.Researchers atcyber-security company Intel471 say that“pre-Telegram this activity was predominantly done in online markets hosted using hidden dark web services” but for lower-level, lesser-skilled cyber-criminals, “Telegram has become one of the most popular online destinations”.The hacker group Qilin, which held NHS hospitals to ransom earlier this summer, notably chose topublish stolen blood test dataon its Telegram channel before its dark web website. The deepfake service used to create fake nudes ofschoolgirls in Spainand South Korea also runs its full service, including payment, on Telegram.Some of the Telegram criminal channels I was added to seem to have a presence on Snapchat and drug dealers can be found on Instagram too, where deals are no doubt being made in private chats.But drug dealers can often be seen advertising their Telegram channels on those other sites to funnel people to that platform.In January, state police in Latviaset up a separate unitspecialising in monitoring chat apps for drug trafficking and communication, and officials have named Telegram as a particular concern.
Child abuse material
Telegram says that its moderation is “within industry standards”, but this week we have seen evidence to the contrary related to an area of criminality far less visible (and one I did not search for) - child sexual abuse material.On Wednesday, the BBC learned that while Telegram does respond to some takedown requests from police and charities,it is not participatingin programmes aimed to proactively prevent the spread of images and videos of child sexual abuse.Not doing enough to police child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is one of the chief allegations from French prosecutors.“At the heart of this case is the lack of moderation and co-operation of the platform, in particular in the fight against crimes against children,” said Jean-Michel Bernigaud, the secretary general of French child protection agency Ofmin, on LinkedIn.Telegram told the BBC it does proactively search for illegal activity, including child sexual abuse, on its site. It said undisclosed action was taken against 45,000 groups in August alone.The press office did not respond to follow-up questions about this or anything else in this article.
Not co-operating with police
Moderation is only part of the problem for Telegram. Its approach to police requests to remove illegal content and pass on evidence is another criticism.As Brian Fishman, a co-founder of Cinder, a software platform for trust and safety, posted: “Telegram is another level: it has been the key hub for Isis for a decade. It tolerates CSAM. It's ignored reasonable law enforcement engagement for years. It’s not 'light' content moderation; it’s a different approach entirely.”Some might argue that Telegram’s privacy features mean that the company does not have much data about this activity to report to police. This is the case with ultra-private apps like Signal and WhatsApp.
Telegram offers users similar levels of privacy if they opt to create a “Secret Chat” which uses the same end-to-end encryption that those apps do. It means the activity inside a conversation is completely private and not even Telegram itself can view the contents.However, this function is not set as default on Telegram, and it seems that most of the activity on the app - including on those illicit groups I was added to - are not set as ""secret"". In fact, group chats can't be set as 'Secret' at all.Telegram could read all content and pass it on to police if it wanted to, but it states in its terms and conditions that it does not.“All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them,” the company’s terms and condition read.In June Pavel Durov told journalist Tucker Carlson that he only employs “about 30 engineers” to run his platform.Telegram’s cold approach to law enforcement is something that I have been told about on the fringes of press events by frustrated police officers.French authorities noted in their statements about Mr Durov’s charges that police there and in Belgium had historically an “almost total lack of response from Telegram to legal requests”.
Freedom of speech
In spite of all the criticism against Telegram’s approach to moderation, there are some who are concerned that Mr Durov’s arrest is a troubling time.
Digital rights organisation Access Now says it is watching developments with great concern.In a statement,the campaigners for an open internet said that Telegram is ""no model for corporate responsibility"" and that the group had criticised the app many times in the past.Access Now warns, however, that ""detaining the staff of platforms that people use to exercise their rights to free expression and peaceful assembly, without demonstrable alignment with human rights principles, may result in over-censorship, and could further shrink civic spaces"".Telegram itself has repeatedly said that “it is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of that platform”.Elon Musk, fellow billionaire and owner of X (formerly Twitter), has condemned the arrest and described it as an attack on freedom of speech. He is calling for Mr Durov to be released.So too are some of the criminals on the Telegram groups I am now a member of, with FreeDurov imagery being shared in English and Russian widely."
Telegram boss banned from leaving France in criminal probe,"Telegram boss and founder Pavel Durov has been placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime on the messaging app, Paris prosecutors say.Mr Durov, 39, has not been remanded in custody, but placed under judicial supervision, and has to pay a €5m (£4.2m; $5.6m) deposit.The Russian-born billionaire, who is also a French national, also has to show up at a French police station twice a week and is not allowed to leave French territory.Mr Durov wasfirst detained upon arrival at Le Bourget airportnorth of Paris last Saturday under a warrant for offences related to the app.
In Wednesday's statement, the Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was put under formal investigation over alleged offences that included:Complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable illicit transactions by an organised gangRefusal to communicate with authoritiesComplicity in organised criminal distribution of sexual images of childrenIn France, being put under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily result in a trial - but it indicates that judges consider there is enough of a case to proceed with an investigation.Mr Durov has so far made no public comments on the latest developments.His lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, said Telegram complied in every respect with European digital regulations and was moderated to the same standards as other social networks.It was ""absurd"" to suggest his client could be involved ""in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly"", he added.It is unprecedented for the owner of a social media platform to be arrested because of the way in which that platform is being used, and it has fuelled a fierce debate online about freedom of speech and accountability.We have previously seen tech bosses hauled in front of lawmakers for confrontational grillings about their practices and failings, but not met by law enforcement at airports.Elon Musk, the owner of X, has defended Mr Durov, arguing that moderation is a ""propaganda word"" for censorship. He has called for Mr Durov's release.Chris Pavlovski, the founder of a controversial video-sharing app called Rumble, said he had fled Europe following Mr Durov’s detention.While most of the world’s largest social networks do engage with national and international bodies when it comes to serious criminal offences such as the sharing of child sexual abuse images, Telegram is accused of ignoring them.The firm, which is now headquartered in Dubai, insists that its moderation tools meet industry standards.French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that France was deeply committed to freedom of expression, and that the decision to hold Mr Durov was ""in no way... political"".Huge groups of up to 200,000 people can share and comment on information and content on Telegram - WhatsApp on the other hand limits its maximum group size to just over 1,000.While Telegram messages can be encrypted, meaning that only the sender and recipient can view them, this is not activated by default and has to be manually switched on to private chats.
On Monday evening, Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was being held in custody as part of a cyber-criminality investigation. In response, Telegram said Mr Durov had ""nothing to hide"".Russia has warned France against turning the case into what it described as a ""political persecution"", having previously said that without serious evidence the charges could be construed as an act of ""intimidation"".""We know that the president of France has denied any connection [to the case] with politics,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday, according to Reuters.""But on the other hand, certain accusations are being made.""Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said that the charges against Mr Durov sounded ""wild"" and that the Telegram CEO was a ""hostage of the dictatorship of democracy of the collective West"".Telegram is ranked as one of the major social media platforms.It was founded in 2013 and is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet Union states, as well as Iran.Russian war correspondent Sasha Kots wondered whether users would ever ""trust Telegram as before"".Kots, who regularly posts updates about the war in Ukraine to his large Telegram following, suggested that French and Western authorities might now have access to the network's encryption keys.""The truth is that no matter how events around Durov develop now, one can never be sure of the security of the messenger,"" he wrote on Telegram.The BBC revealed on Wednesday that Telegram - which has more than 950 million registered users -has repeatedly refused to join international programmesaimed at detecting and removing child abuse material online.The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment about its refusal to join the child protection schemes.Mr Durov, who also founded the popular Russian social media company VKontakte, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.He also holds passports of St Kitts and Nevis and the United Arab Emirates."
Who is Pavel Durov and what is Telegram?,"Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of messaging app Telegram, has been placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime on the messaging app.Prosecutors in Paris also said the 39-year-old billionaire has not been remanded in custody, but placed under judicial supervision, and has to pay a €5m (£4.2m; $5.6m) deposit.Mr Durov, who is also a French national, has to show up at a French police station twice a week and is not allowed to leave French territory.The actions from the prosecutors in France is the latest stage in this ongoing story, which has caused considerable shock in the world of technology.It is unprecedented for the owner of a social media or messaging platform to be arrested because of the way in which that platform is being used, and it has fuelled a debate about freedom of speech, accountability and the role of social media and messaging company bosses within all of that.Mr Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, said Telegram complied in every respect with European digital regulations and was moderated to the same standards as other social networks.He said it was ""absurd"" to suggest his client could be involved ""in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly"".
Who is Pavel Durov?
Mr Durov is a multi-billionaire who is originally from Russia.He founded the popular Russian social media company VKontakte.In 2014, Mr Durov left Russia after refusing tocomply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.A year earlier, he had founded Telegram and now runs the firm from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he now lives.He holds citizenship of the UAE and France, but Russia has said it still regards him as a citizen.After he was arrested, Telegram said Mr Durov travelled in Europe frequently.In an interview with the conservative US media personality Tucker Carlson in April, Mr Durov said he would refuse certain requests from authorities to remove content from his platform.He said: ""Where we thought it would be crossing the line - it wouldn't be aligning with our values of freedom of speech and protecting people's private correspondence - we would ignore.""
What is Telegram?
Telegram is one of the world's biggest social media and messaging platforms along with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and WeChat.In July, Mr Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users. It is popular in Russia and Ukraine, while pro-democracy groups in Iran and Hong Kong also use it.Telegram does offer end to end encryption, which means the messages can only be read on the device that sends them and the device that receives them, but this is not the default setting for the user.The big difference between Telegram and similar services like WhatsApp is the size of groups you can be in on Telegram.WhatsApp limits group sizes to 1,000 users whereas up to 200,000 can be in a group on Telegram.
The platform has faced criticism that disinformation can spread in these huge groups.Critics have argued the platform has seen the sharing of conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content.In the UK, the app was scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising this month's violent disorder in English cities and cybersecurity experts say its moderation of extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than other social media companies and messenger apps.Following Mr Durov's arrest, Telegram said its moderation ""is within industry standards and constantly improving"".It said it abides by European Union laws, including the Digital Services Act, which aims to ensure a safe and accountable online environment.""Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as means of communication and as a source of vital information,"" the app's statement read.""We’re awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation. Telegram is with you all.""
What has been said about Durov's arrest?
In Wednesday's statement, the Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was put under formal investigation over alleged offences that included:Complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable illicit transactions by an organised gangRefusal to communicate with authoritiesComplicity in organised criminal distribution of sexual images of childrenIn France, being put under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily result in a trial - but it indicates that judges consider there is enough of a case to proceed with an investigation.Elon Musk, the owner of X, has been defending Mr Durov for several days in a series of posts on his platform, formerly known as Twitter.He said moderation is a “propaganda word” for censorship, and called for Mr Durov's release.Chris Pavlovski, the founder of a controversial video-sharing app called Rumble, said he had fled Europe following Mr Durov’s detention.Earlier this week Edward Snowden, the American whistleblower who now lives in Russia after revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence, said on X that Mr Durov's arrest was ""an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"".He added: ""I am surprised and deeply saddened that [French President Emmanuel] Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications. It lowers not only France, but the world.""After some details of the arrest had emerged, Vyacheslav Volodin - a prominent Russian politician and ally of Vladimir Putin - accused the US of being behind the arrest of Mr Durov.""Telegram is one of the few and at the same time the largest internet platforms over which the United States has no influence,"" he said in a post on the platform.President Macron posted on social media on Monday that he had seen ""false information"" regarding France following Mr Durov’s arrest, and added: ""This is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to decide."""
Telegram repeatedly refuses to join child protection schemes,"The BBC has learned that Telegram - the messaging app service whose boss has been arrested in France - refuses to join international programmes aimed at detecting and removing child abuse material online.The app is not a member of either the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) or the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - both of which work with most online platforms to find, report and remove such material.It comes as the founder and chief executive of the app - which has more than 950 million registered users - remains under investigation in France.Billionaire Pavel Durov has been detained over alleged offences relating to a lack of moderation on the platform.According to officials the 39-year-old is accused of failure to co-operate with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual content and fraud.Telegram says it proactively moderates harmful content on its platform including child abuse material. The company insists that its moderation is ""within industry standards and constantly improving"".However, unlike all other social networks, it is not signed up to programmes like NCMEC’s CyberTipline which has more than 1,600 internet companies registered.US-based firms are legally required to sign up but 16% of the companies who participate are not based in the US.Telegram is based in Dubai, where Mr Durov lives.Who is Pavel Durov and what is Telegram?The vast majority of child sexual abuse material reports came from tech giants and social networks including Facebook, Google, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter (X), Snapchat and WhatsApp.The BBC understands that NCMEC has repeatedly asked Telegram to join to help tackle child sexual abuse material (CSAM) but it has ignored requests.Telegram also refuses to work with the Internet Watch Foundation, which is the UK’s equivalent of NCMEC.An IWF spokesperson said: “Despite attempts to proactively engage with Telegram over the last year, they are not members of the IWF and do not take any of our services to block, prevent, and disrupt the sharing of child sexual abuse imagery.""By not being an active part of IWF or NCMEC, Telegram is not able to proactively find, remove or block confirmed CSAM which is categorised and added to lists compiled by the charities.IWF said that the company did remove CSAM once material was confirmed but said it was slower and less responsive to day-to-day requests.The BBC contacted Telegram for comment about its refusal to join the child protection schemes and received a response after publication which has been included.Telegram is also not a part of the TakeItDown programme that works to remove so-called revenge porn.Snap, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Pornhub and OnlyFans are all members of the scheme that uses a so-called hash list to scan for images and videos on their public or unencrypted platforms.
Another norm that Telegram does not conform to in the usual way is Transparency Reporting.Every six months social networks publish a list of all the content taken down because of police requests.Most other social networks including Meta's apps, Snapchat and TikTok publish their reports online with previous years in a library to refer to.Telegram has no such website and only a channel on the app with no library history of transparency reports. It also describes its approach to Transparency Reports as ""semiannual"".The Telegram Transparency channel did not reply to a request to see previous reports and said that there was ""no report available for your region"".Telegram also has an unusual system for media in general. The contact method is through an automated bot on the app.This reporter has not had a reply in the months of trying to get a response to various requests. A reply was sent to this article but the press team did not respond to follow up questions.In June Pavel Durov told journalist Tucker Carlson that he only employs “about 30 engineers” to run his platform.Mr Durov, who was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, has citizenship in Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis.Telegram is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and former Soviet Union states as well as Iran."
Klarna: AI lets us cut thousands of jobs - but pay more,"The buy now, pay later firm Klarna is seeking to get rid of almost half its employees in the coming years through efficiencies it says arise out of its investment in artificial intelligence (AI).The firm has already cut its workforce from 5,000 to 3,800 in the past year, and wants to reduce that to 2,000 employees by using AI in marketing and customer service.Boss Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the BBC the job cuts would mean Klarna could pay its remaining workers more.But he said the government needed to think about what to do about AI, which he predicted would have ""a dramatic impact"" on jobs and society.""I think politicians already today should consider whether there are other alternatives of how they could support people that may be effective,"" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4.He said it was ""too simplistic"" to simply say new jobs would be created in the future.""I mean, maybe you can become an influencer, but it's hard to do so if you are 55-years-old,"" he said.The recent proliferation of AI has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight.Earlier this year,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saidit believed AI would impact nearly 40% of all jobs, and it would ""likely worsen overall inequality"".In other sectors, such as the games industry, developers have warnedthey are already losing work to AI.
Union fears
Klarna - which is based in Sweden, and has two UK offices - disclosed its job-cutting plans as it announced interim results which showed it increased its revenue by 27% to 13.3 billion Swedish krona (£990 million).""Our proven scale efficiencies have been enhanced by our investment in AI, which has driven down operating expenses and improved gross profits,"" it said.It comes as unions have warned of mass job losses amid the growth of AI and are calling for legislation to protect workers.Mr Siemiatkowski  said Klarna would reduce its headcount through what he called ""natural attrition"" - effectively a hiring freeze, where staff aren't replaced after they leave.Typically this means the people that remain are left with an increased workload.But Mr Siemiatkowski contended that AI would be replacing this work, and even claimed it was a potential ""positive development"" for some individuals who may be paid more.While he said it was ""critical"" for government to consider what to do about those who lost their jobs, he suggested there was no ""stopping progress"" for firms like his.""It's important that Europe and democracies are ahead in the evolution of AI,"" he said.Klarna is understood to be shrinking its workforce ahead of a listing on the stock exchange, which has recently been dominated by firms heavily investing in AI, such as Nvidia and Microsoft.This means Klarna being seen as a big proponent of the tech may make its stock more appealing to investors when it does eventually go public."
Esports champ wants to get into real world of motorsport,"Eight weeks, hundreds of competitors across multiple events and a multi-million pound prize pot - but this wasn't any sports tournament.Luke Bennett is coming home from the first Esports World Cup in Saudi Arabia as a world champion.Not only that, the 19-year-old from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is also returning £100,000 richer after bagging the top prize in sim racing (short for simulated racing).""It’s pretty surreal,"" Luke tells BBC Newsbeat. But now he's hoping he has a chance to make it properly real with a career in motorsport.
Luke's part of Team Redline – an offshoot of Red Bull’s F1 team which boasts Belgian-Dutch racing driver Max Verstappen among its alumni.""It's just like racing a car in real life,"" Luke says of sim racing. ""But on a computer.""The team was founded more than 20 years ago but Luke says people are still surprised when he talks about what he does.He says people are shocked when he tells them about the prize money involved.""It shows it’s getting bigger and bigger and it can be a career for some people.""Team Redline dominated at the Esports World Cup, never finishing outside of the top four once in the grand finals of the tournament.""It’s been a rough few months,"" says Luke. ""Every day – practice, practice, practice.""All that weight has been lifted off our shoulders now.""
The future's 'uncertain'
Luke isn't just fast on the virtual track. He says his career is moving at top speed as well.""I started driving with just a £100 steering wheel on the desk and having a bit of fun,"" he says.Not long after, fellow competitors noticed his potential and his parents helped him buy a better simulator.""That’s when things really took off,"" he says.""I joined Team Redline and after that it’s just been up and up and up until this point right now.""Esports tournaments are still ""quite niche and quite new,"" he says.""It’s not been long since all this prize money started coming through and all these big competitions started so there’s not many stories of people going all the way.""In that sense, he's a pioneer, admitting ""the future is a bit uncertain"" for esports champions.
But as uncertain as it might be, the industry received another boost last month when it was announced from next yearthere would also be an Olympic Esports Games.Like the Esports World Cup, the Games will be held in Saudi Arabia as part of a 12-year partnership between the Kingdom and the International Olympics Committee.Before the World Cup, players, streamers and fans were divided by the decision for it to be hosted in the Arab country - which also funded the prize pot - due to its record on human rights.Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and it has faced criticism over its stance on LGBT relationships as well as lack of rights for women.Critics condemned it as ""sportswashing"" but the decision was defended by organisers whotold Newsbeat no-one would face discrimination at the event.
Luke says the country was ""a really cool setting"" for the event and now has his eye on winning more tournaments and making it to the Olympics - something he says would be ""unbelievable"".""I think I’d find it a bit weird calling myself an Olympian because I really don’t feel like one,"" he says.""But it’s something that would be very cool.""The dream is still the same – we may be world champions but there’s always more.""We want to be world champions in everything, so we’ll keep going.""
And if he can be a pioneer in an online esports career, Luke sees no reason he can't be a pioneer offline too.""I hope one day to get into the real world of motorsport,"" he says.""I see more and more people get a way in through sim racing now, and hopefully that does happen.""If not, I’ve got plenty of time to decide what I want to do as I’m still only 19.""

Can Barbie help beat teen smartphone addiction?,"A Barbie-branded phone has been launched in the UK and Europe with the aim – its makers say – of helping young people take a break from their smartphones.It is a very pink and fundamentally very basic device, with no front camera, only one game and very limited access to the internet.Manufacturer HMD, which also makes phones for Nokia, says it's trying to tap into what it calls a ""surge"" of people wanting a smaller ""digital impact"" on their lives.But others say that would be better achieved by teaching people how to use their devices in a healthier and more controlled way.
There are growing calls from parents and campaigners to limit the time children spend on smartphones, or even ban the devices completely.Their concerns range from the suspicion children will end up with shorter attention spans, to the fear that they might be exposed to harmful or illegal content.Some schools are taking action, perhaps most eye-catchinglythe UK's best known fee-paying school, Eton College. It is providing some of its pupils with ""brick"" phones – also sometimes called feature phones – which can only send and receive texts and calls.It says it wants to ""balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.""And this weekmobile network EE waded into the debateby advising parents not to allow their under-11s smartphones at all.Lars Silberbauer, a senior executive at HMD, says it is these trends his firm is responding to.""We've seen this surge which started in the US coming to Europe, that more and more people actually want to not be having a digital experience all the time,"" he said.
Digital detox
Some may be sceptical about how truly noble Mr Silberbauer's motives are – and he did concede he would “love” to be able to incorporate a messaging platform like WhatsApp into the Barbie phone.But I spent a day using it and, for now, there is little doubt that as a digital detox it was certainly effective because of its very limited functionality.It is mirror-fronted flip phone and has no app store or touch screen. I had no social media at all, and the phone can not receive anything more advanced than SMS messages.That means no text messages with ""read receipts"" or the function to see when someone is typing. It is the default setting on many smartphones – so I didn’t get many text messages either.Even with predictive text enabled I found the numbers and letters keypad much slower than a touchscreen keyboard and as a result I ended up calling more people than usual, which perhaps was no bad thing.And I discovered there are only so many times you can play the retro Nokia game Snake, even when it’s called Malibu Snake and it's pink.But the handset certainly attracted a lot of attention, especially from girls and young women, as I walked around Glasgow city centre with it.There is of course the danger that instead of being pestered for a smartphone, parents will find themselves being pestered for a piece of Barbie merchandise - which may be just as unwelcome.The phone has a launch price of £99 in the UK – twice what you would pay for a non-branded Nokia feature phone. There are plenty of other phones on the market that offer the same limited functionality, but without any kind of big corporate tie in.""I’d imagine quite a few people will be tempted to buy it as a bit of fun, but in reality, everyone is so dependent on their smartphones that anything more than the odd day of detox will be a stretch,"" says Ben Wood, a phone expert who has his own museum of devices released over the years.Nonetheless, he says, there is a market for what are sometimes called ""dumbphones"". His firm, CCS Insight, estimates that around 400,000 will be sold in the UK this year.""That's an attractive niche for a company like HMD"", he says.Some experts suggest that withdrawing smartphones is no real solution – they are woven into our lives, after all – and instead children need to be taught how to use them in a healthy and safe way.""What we should be doing instead is thinking about, how do we build really good, really long term, sustainable digital literacy skills in that generation,"" says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa university, who has written extensively about the issue of screen time.“I think we could all be better at using our phones in a healthier and more resilient way,"" he said.HMD is also working on a separate project, a new device which it is designing in collaboration with parents. It says more than 1,000 people have signed up to work on it so far.And Mr Silberbaum concedes that the resulting handset may well end up being something that sits somewhere between a dumbphone and a smartphone.“Do I want the smartphone with all the bells and whistles, or do I want to have something that can actually help me have a more considered approach to digital? That's the choice we want to deliver,” he said."
Zuckerberg regrets bowing to Biden 'pressure' over Covid,"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg says he regrets bowing to what he calls pressure from the Biden administration to ""censor"" content on Facebook and Instagram during the coronavirus pandemic.In a letter sent to a US House committee chair, he said some material – including humour and satire – was taken down in 2021 under pressure from senior officials.The White House has defended its actions, saying it encouraged ""responsible actions to protect public health and safety"".Mr Zuckerberg also said his firm briefly ""demoted"" content relating to Joe Biden's son, Hunter, ahead of the 2020 election, after the FBI warned of ""a potential Russian disinformation"" operation.It later became clear that this content was not part of such an operation, Mr Zuckerberg said, and it should not have been temporarily taken down.Mr Zuckerberg did not give further detail about the actions he regretted during the pandemic. At that time, his business removed posts for a variety of reasons.Mr Zuckerberg said the decisions made were the decisions of his business, but that the “government pressure was wrong”.He continued: ""We made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today.""Mr Zuckerberg said he and Meta would be ready to ""push back"" if something similar happened in the future.His letter was addressed to Jim Jordan, the chair of the House judiciary committee, which has been investigating content moderation on online platforms. Republicans said the letter was a ""big win for free speech"".In a statementissued to the website Politico, the White House stood by its actions.It said: “Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.”
Hunter Biden controversy
Mr Zuckerberg's comments on Hunter Biden refer to the story of a laptop that was abandoned by the president's son at a repair shop in Delaware - as first reported by the New York Post.The newspaper claimed emails found on the computer suggested his business abroad had influenced US foreign policy while his father was vice-president.The president and his family have denied any wrongdoing.The story became a notable right-wing talking point in the US, and a point of contention as some social media platforms censored the content.Mr Zuckerberg said the story was temporarily demoted on his platforms while going through a fact-check - after a warning from the FBI of a potential Russian disinformation operation, and ""in retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote.""We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again.""Mr Zuckerberg also said he did not plan to make any more contributions to supporting electoral infrastructure.In 2020, he donated $400m (£302m) via his philanthropic Chan Zuckerberg Initiative which was intended to help government offices conduct the election during the pandemic.However, misinformation spread rapidly on social media accusing Mr Zuckerberg of effectively using a loophole to skirt maximum donation limits in a bid to get Mr Biden elected.Mr Zuckerberg said his donations ""were designed to be non-partisan"".""Still, despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other.""My goal is to be neutral and not play a role on way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role - so I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle."""
Telegram CEO Pavel Durov arrested at French airport,"Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov has been arrested by French police at an airport north of Paris.Mr Durov was detained after his private jet had landed at Le Bourget Airport, French media reported.According to officials the 39-year-old billionaire was arrested under a warrant for offences related to the popular messaging app. The investigation is reportedly about a lack of moderation, with Mr Durov accused of failing to take steps to curb criminal uses of Telegram.The app is accused of failure to cooperate with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual content and fraud. Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation.
Pavel Durov was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, where Telegram is based. He holds dual citizenship of the United Arab Emirates and France.Telegram is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and former Soviet Union states.The app was banned in Russia in 2018, after a previous refusal by him to hand over user data. The ban was reversed in 2021.Telegram isranked as one of the major social media platformsafter Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and Wechat.Mr Durov founded Telegram in 2013. Heleft Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demandsto shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform, which he sold.On Sunday, the Russian Embassy in France wrote on Facebook that it was seeking to ""clarify the reasons for the detention and to provide for the protection of Mr Durov’s rights and facilitate consular access"".The post added that French authorities had not been cooperating with Russian officials.Russian Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted on Telegram asking whether Western human rights NGOs would be silent on Mr Durov's arrest, after they criticised Russia’s decision to “create obstacles” to the work of Telegram in Russia in 2018.Several Russian officials condemned the businessman's arrest, saying it showed the West has double standards when it comes to free speech and democracy.Americanwhistleblower Edward Snowden, who has been living in exile in Russia since 2013, said on X that Mr Durov's arrest ""was an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"".X owner Elon Musk, who has faced extensive criticism over moderation and material hosted by his own social media site, posted repeatedly about the situation.He hashtagged one post #freepavel, and in another wrote: ""POV [Point of view]: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme.""Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which critics have argued makes it easier for misinformation to spread, and for users to share conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content.In the UK, the app was scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising the violent disorder in English cities earlier this month.Telegram did remove some groups, but overall its system of moderating extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than that of other social media companies and messenger apps, say cybersecurity experts.Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified Pavel Durov's lawyer. It has been updated to remove the reference."
