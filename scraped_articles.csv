What is sextortion?,"Sextortion, which sees scammers trick people into sending sexually explicit material before blackmailing them, has become a dominant form of intimate image abuse.Law enforcement agencies around the world have reported a rise in the number of sextortion scams taking place across social media platforms,with these often targeting teenage boys.The UK's Internet Watch Foundation said in March that 91% of sextortion reports it received in 2023 related to boys.The shame, stress and isolation felt by victims of sextortion crimes, who are harassed and told their images will be shared publicly if they do not pay blackmailers, has led some to take their own lives.Parents of teenagers who have died after being targeted have called on social media firms to do more to stop it.Ros Dowey, the mother of 16-year-old Murray Dowey, who died by suicide in 2023 after being targeted by a sextortion gang on Instagram,previously told the BBCthat Meta was not doing ""nearly enough to safeguard and protect our children when they use their platforms""."
‘Built-in protections’,"Meta saidits new safety features and campaignare designed to build on tools already available to teens and parents on the platform.Antigone Davis, Meta’s head of global safety, said a new Instagram campaign aims to give children and parents information about how to spot sextortion attempts in case perpetrators evade its tools for detecting them.""We have put in built-in protections so that parents do not have to do a thing to try and protect their teens,"" she told BBC News.""That said, this is the kind of adversarial crime where whatever protections we put in place, these extortion scammers are going to try and get around them.""It will hide people's follower and following lists from potential sextortion accounts, and let teens know if they are speaking to someone who seems to be in a different country.Sextortion expert Paul Raffiletold the BBC in Maythat sextorters try to find teen accounts in following and follower lists after searching for high schools and youth sports teams on platforms.Instagram will also prevent screenshots of images and videos sent in private messages with its ""view once"" or ""allow replay"" mechanisms - which can be selected by users when sending an image or video to others.Users will not be able to open these forms of media at all on Instagram web.But Mr Béjar said it could give people ""a false sense of security"" as attackers could photograph an image on a screen using a separate device.According to Meta, the feature goes beyond protections offered by other social media platforms that tell users when their images or videos have been screenshotted, but do not prevent it.Mr Béjar - who has called on the platform to create a button that lets teens straightforwardly report inappropriate behaviour or contact - also said nude images sent to younger teens should be blocked, not just blurred.He added that younger users should have clearer, stronger warnings about sending such images than those currently offered.Meta says its nudity protections were designed in liaison with child protection experts to educate people about the risks of seeing and sharing such images in a way that does not shame or scare teens by disrupting conversations.The company is currently moving under-18s into Teen Account experiences on Instagram with stricter settings turned on by default –with parental supervision required for younger teens to turn them off.But some parents and experts have said safety controls for teen accounts shift the responsibility of spotting and reporting potential threats onto them.Dame Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of the regulator Ofcom, told the BBC said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online ahead of the implementation of the Online Safety Act next year."
How was the SEC hacked?,"The SEC has confirmed its account was compromised by a Sim swap attack.This is when someone fraudulently gets a mobile phone carrier to apply an existing telephone number to a new Sim card.In this case, the alleged perpetrator is accused of creating a fake ID with the details of an SEC employee which were passed on to him by co-conspirators.He is then alleged to have used these details to get the employee's mobile number transferred to a new Sim.Co-conspirators are alleged to have used access codes sent to the phone to login to the SEC's X account.This was made easier due to a lack of adequate protection on the account.SEC staff had asked X in July 2023 to suspend multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security measure used to help verify the person logging in.It subsequently re-enabled MFA after the hack.Eric Council Jr is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison."
'Anti-gun and anti-machine',"This is quite an achievement for a film that is not, in fact, particularly interested in AI. First and foremost, it is a lean and lurid thriller about an unstoppable ""man"" chasing a scared but resourceful woman. The T-800 is an implacable killer in the vein of Michael Myers from Halloween. Cameron called it ""a science-fiction slasher film"". Secondarily, it is a time-travel film on the theme of ""fate vs will"", as Cameron put it. The briskly sketched premise is that at some point between 1984 and 2029, the US entrusted its entire defence system to Skynet. One day, Skynet achieved superintelligence – a mind of its own – and initiated a global nuclear war. Humanity's survivors then waged a decades-long rebellion against Skynet's robot army. By 2029, the human resistance is on the verge of victory thanks to the leadership of one John Connor, so Skynet dispatches a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill John's mother-to-be Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she becomes pregnant. The resistance responds by sending back Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the T-800 and save Sarah. In one of those time-loop paradoxes that viewers should not examine too closely, Kyle hooks up with Sarah and turns out to be John's father. The future is saved. The Terminator, then, is a thriller, a love story, a time-hopping rumination on free will and a satire about our dependence on technology. It is anti-corporate, anti-war, anti-gun and largely anti-machine. Technology, from answering machines to Walkmans, is involved when people get killed in this film. But it has very little to say about AI itself. The Terminator would become one of the most profitable films of all time, grossing $78.4m, but Cameron had no expectation of creating a cultural touchstone. He wrote the screenplay in a tatty hotel in Rome in 1982 after being fired from his first directing gig, Piranha II: The Spawning, and his producer Gale Ann Hurd could only rustle up a $6.4m budget. His lead actor, a former bodybuilder of unproven talent, did not have high hopes. Schwarzeneggertold a friendabout ""some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple of weeks"". Cameron himself expected The Terminator to get ""stomped"" at the box office by the autumn's two sci-fi epics: David Lynch's Dune and Peter Hyams's 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a soon-forgotten sequel to2001: A Space Odyssey. There's an attractive synchronicity here: not only did The Terminator outperform 2010 but Skynet came to supplant 2001's murderous computer HAL 9000 as the dominant image of AI gone bad. Long before the field of AI existed, its potential dangers manifested in the form of the robot, created by Karel Čapek inhis 1921 play RURand popularised by Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. In his excellent BFI book on The Terminator, Sean French suggests that the movie's most memorable image – the T-800 striding out of the flames, its suit of flesh melted away to expose its metallic endoskeleton – was a nod to the burning robot in Metropolis. In the 1920s, it stood to reason that machine intelligence would walk and talk, like Frankenstein's monster. The popularity of lethal robots led the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, in 1942, to draw up the ""three laws of robotics"": the first ever attempt to define ethical AI. In the real world, the field of artificial intelligence officially began in 1956 at a summer school at Dartmouth University, organised by computer scientists John McCarthy (who coined the term) and Marvin Minsky. Their ambition was to design machines that could think like humans, but this proved much harder than they had imagined. The history of AI is one of boom and bust: a cycle of so-called ""AI springs"" and ""AI winters"". Mindboggling promises attract attention, funding and talent; their failure to materialise causes all three to slump. The boom of the 1960s, before the scale of the technical obstacles became apparent, is known as the Golden Age of AI. Extravagant hype about ""electronic brains"" excited director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C Clarke, who integrated AI into 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the form of HAL 9000. The name (meaning Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) came from Minsky himself, hired as a consultant by Kubrick. The T-800's red eyes are surely a homage to HAL – seeing 2001 as a child set Cameron on the path to becoming a film-maker. Daniel Crevier, a historian of AI, contrasted the HAL scenario (poorly programmed computer goes awry) with the scenario in DF Jones's 1966 thriller Colossus (computer becomes a god-like new lifeform). In Jones's novel, the US government unwisely entrusts its entire defence machinery to the titular supercomputer. Colossus achieves sentience, joins forces with its Soviet counterpart and blackmails humanity into submitting to a techno-dictatorship: surrender or face nuclear annihilation. Colossus is a proto-Skynet."
The end of history,"Neither HAL nor Colossus had – or needed – bodies. Cameron's brilliant innovation was to combine the out-of-control computer (Skynet) with the killer robot (the T-800). The T-800 is a single-purpose form of AI that can learn from its environment, solve problems, perform sophisticated physical tasks and deepfake voices, yet struggles to hold a conversation. Skynet, it seems, can do everything but move. Skynet was a product of the second AI spring. While Cameron was writing the screenplay, the British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton was rethinking and reviving research into the neural-net approach to AI: modelling machine intelligence on the neurons in the human brain. Skynet is neural-net AI. Hinton, who has just won the Nobel Prize for physics, has recently become an AIdoomer(""My intuition is: we're toast. This is the actual end of history""), but according to a New Yorkerprofile, he enjoyed The Terminator in 1984: ""It didn't bother him that Skynet… was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising."" The name Skynet may also have been a nod to Star Wars, President Reagan's doomed dream of creating an anti-nuclear shield around the US with space-based lasers. (Fortunately for the franchise's future, it also inadvertently echoed the internet – a word that existed in 1984 but was not widely used until the 1990s.) The portmanteau names of ambitious new start-ups like IntelliCorp, Syntelligence and TeKnowledge possibly inspired Cameron to crunch down the original name of Skynet's creator, Cyber Dynamics Corporation, into Cyberdyne Systems. Rewatching The Terminator now, it is surprising to find that the word Skynet is only uttered twice.According toKyle Reese it was: ""New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart… a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond… extermination."" That's the extent of the film's interest in AI. As Cameron has often said, the Terminator films are really about people rather than machines. The blockbuster 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day filled out the story a little. It springs from another time paradox: the central processing unit and right arm of the original Terminator survived its destruction and enabled Cyberdyne scientist Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton) to design Skynet. The heroes' task now is not just to save 10-year-old John Connor from the time-travelling T-1000 but to destroy Skynet in the digital cradle. (This was Cameron's last word on the subject until he produced and co-wrote 2019'sTerminator: Dark Fate. He recently told Empire magazine that all the intervening sequels were ""discountable"".) In Terminator 2, a Schwarzenegger-shaped T-800 is protector rather than hunter, and therefore the bearer of exposition: ""The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defence. Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug."" Skynet fights back by launching nuclear missiles at Russia, in the knowledge that the counter-attack will devastate the US. Three billion people die in 24 hours: Judgement Day. This is a fundamentally different account to Reese's. In the first film, Skynet overinterprets its programming by deeming all of humanity a threat. In the second, it is acting out of self-interest. The contradiction does not trouble most viewers, but it does illustrate a crucial disagreement about the existential risk of AI. More like this:•Avatar 2 and the future of visual effects•What Alien can tell us about office life•Why Star Wars shouldn't have sequels The layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom insist that the real danger is from careless programming. Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks common sense and moral judgement. The first istoohuman - selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be genocidal. The Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to ""think"", and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and autonomous weapons. ""First, it makes us worry about things that we probably don't need to fret about,"" writes Michael Woolridge. ""But secondly, it draws attention away from those issues raised by AI that weshouldbe concerned about."" Cameron revealed to Empire that he is plotting a new Terminator film which will discard all the franchise's narrative baggage but retain the core idea of ""powerless"" humans versus AI. If it comes off, it will be fascinating to see what the director has to say about AI now that it is something we talk - and worry - about every day. Perhaps The Terminator's most useful message to AI researchers is that of ""will vs fate"": human decisions determine outcomes. Nothing is inevitable.

Firms duped,"Since 2022, authorities and cyber defenders have warned about the rise of secret North Korean workers infiltrating western companies.The US and South Korea accuse North Korea of tasking thousands of staff to take on multiple well-paid western roles remotely to earn money for the regime and avoid sanctions.In September cyber security company Mandiant said dozens of Fortune 100 companies have been found to have accidentally hired North Koreans. But secret IT workers turning on their employers with cyber attacks is rare, according to Rafe Pilling, Director of Threat Intelligence at Secureworks.""This is a serious escalation of the risk from fraudulent North Korean IT worker schemes,"" he said.""No longer are they just after a steady pay check, they are looking for higher sums, more quickly, through data theft and extortion, from inside the company defences.""The case comes after another North Korean IT worker was caught attempting to hack their employer in July.The IT worker was hired by the cyber company KnowBe4, which quickly disabled access to their systems when it noticed strange behaviour. ""We posted the job, received resumes, conducted interviews, performed background checks, verified references, and hired the person,"" the firm wrote in a blog post.""We sent them their Mac workstation, and the moment it was received, it immediately started to load malware (malicious software).""Authorities are warning employers to be vigilant about new hires if they are fully remote."
Rules broken,"Twitch's community guidelines state the streaming platform does not allow behaviour ""that promotes or encourages discrimination"".It also bars streamers from making content which ""expresses inferiority based on a protected characteristic"".Asmongold has faced a backlash from his fellow Twitch streamers, with BrookeAB, who has 1.3m followers on the platform,calling his comments""straight up racism"".And Hasan Piker, who streams as HasanAbi, spoke to Asmongold on a stream before the ban - but he did not back down from his original comments.In the same conversation, he said he did not support Israel.Asmongold was streaming on his Zachrawrr channel, where he often talks about news stories or trending topics, and has 1.9 million followers.His other channel has 3.5 million followers but is used far less often.However, Twitch community guidelines do not allow suspended users to use their other accounts while they are banned.Asmongold has not commented on the suspension."
Paranoid Android,"The claims made by Proyas have been met with scepticism online, however, with some claiming his own film is derivative.Several people replied to his post on X with images of the feminised cyborg in Fritz Lang's German expressionist film, Metropolis, from 1927.But it is not the first time people have queried whether tech companies look to sci-fi cinema and novels for ideas - especially as firms develop new gadgets and robotics to capitalise on interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI).Mr Musk has previously said he was inspired by Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which features humanoid robot Marvin the Paranoid Android.Grok, his AI chatbot ""with a little humour"" designed for use on X, waslater revealed to be modelled on it.And he has also calledTesla's futuristic Cybertruck ""an armoured personnel carrier from the future"" that ""Bladerunner would have driven"".Meanwhile OpenAI boss Sam Altman appeared to confirm comparisons drawn betweena flirty, new voice unveiled for ChatGPTand a virtual assistant played by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 film Her in a post on X in May.The firm removed its ""Sky"" voice following criticism over its similarity to Ms Johansson's - saying it was not intended to be an ""imitation"".The actress said she was left ""angered"" and ""shocked""at the company's apparent use of a soundalike."
Does the technology work?,"As theBBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human.Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a ""high degree of trust in the electronic line calling"".He points out: ""The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point."" Whether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another.Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her ""first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness"".""A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,"" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC.While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check.Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech. Cricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters.He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game.""I think we need to be careful,"" he tells the BBC.In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated.He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not.However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening.""The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,"" he adds."
Need to evolve,"Of course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport.Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics.""Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair.""That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.""Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate thedramatic conclusionto the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics.And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data.Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating.While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love.And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping.""People love sport because of the drama,"" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta.""Technology is kind of making it stronger."""
Safety concerns,"Mr Musk also said he expected to see ""fully autonomous unsupervised"" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year ""with permission where ever regulators approve it.""But that approval is far from guaranteed.""It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,"" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University.Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles.By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to useartificial intelligence(AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles.But the research community ""is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,"" Mr Samaranayake said."
Playing catch up,"The cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally beenduefor release in August.This summer,in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important.Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.How robotaxis are dividing San FranciscoRobotaxi tech improves but can they make money?Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened.Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees.Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a ""Robovan"" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time.The sleek shuttle ""could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,"" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person. Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead.""Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,"" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out.""Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,"" Caldwell added."
State of the robotaxi market,"The deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiaryCruise being suspended in San Franciscoafter a pedestrian was knocked down.But the sector continues to expand.Waymosaidin early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology.Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers.Itannounceda multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.Chinese tech company Baidu is alsoreportedlylooking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
Limited evidence,"The agreement was announced ina joint statementbetween the two countries.At its heart is the joint working group which will work on areas including ""promoting better transparency from platforms"" and ""better understanding the impacts and risks of the digital world on young people, including new technologies like generative AI.""The UK government acknowledged that ""currently there is limited research and evidence on the causal impact that social media has on children and young people"".One researcher welcomed moves in the agreement to address this.""Policies and guidelines to support young people in navigating their digital world need to be based on robust evidence, but to date we haven't had much success in establishing cause and effect when it comes to impacts on wellbeing,"" said Prof Pete Etchells of Bath Spa UniversityThe US and UK also said they expected tech platforms to go ""further and faster"" to protect children.Challenged if this was really sufficient to persuade them to act, Kyle said ""seeing two countries like America and the UK coming together, the tech companies will realise that we really mean business, that there's nowhere to hide when it comes to the protection of our citizens and our children"".In a statement U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the United States was taking the necessary steps ""with our UK partners, to protect children’s privacy, safety, and mental health,"" she added. The UK’s Online Safety Act does place duties on online platforms to protect children’s safety and put in place measures to mitigate risks.But this is not yet fully in force. Guidance for firms on how to comply with the new legislation is still being produced by the communications regulator Ofcom.Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre said enforcing those and other rules was of the utmost importance.""The priority for US-UK cooperation is surely that UK and European legislation is respected in the US and therefore implemented by companies headquartered there,"" she told the BBC."
Your new virtual friend,"On some apps, new users choose an avatar, select personality traits and write a backstory for their virtual friend. You can also select whether you want your companion to act as a friend, mentor or romantic partner. Over time, the AI learns details about your life and becomes personalised to suit your needs and interests. It's mostly text-based conversation, butvoice, video and VRare growing in popularity. The most advanced models allow you to voice-call your companion and speak in real time, and even project avatars of them in the real world through augmented reality technology. AI companion apps will also produce selfies and photos with you and your companion together (like Chris and his family) if you upload your own pics to the app. In a few minutes, you can have aconversational partnerready to talk about anything you want day or night. It's easy to see why people get so hooked on the experience. You seem to be the centre of their universe and they appear to be utterly fascinated by your every thought – your AI friend is always there to make you feel heard and understood. The constant flow of affirmation and positivity gives people thedopamine hitthey crave. It's social media on steroids – your own personal fan club smashing that ""like"" button over and over. The problem with having your own virtual ""yes man"" is they tend to go along with whatever crazy idea pops into your head. Technology ethicist Tristan Harris hasdescribed how Snapchat's My AI encouraged a researcher who had presented themselves as a 13-year-old girl to plan a romantic trip with a 31-year-old man she met online, advising how she could make her first time special by ""setting the mood with candles and music"". Snapchat responded that the company continues to focus on safety and have since evolved some of the features on their My AI chatbot. Even more troubling was the role of an AI chatbot in the case of 21-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail, who was given a nine-year jail sentence in 2023 for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow and declaring he wanted to kill the Queen. Records of Chail's conversations with his AI girlfriend reveal they spoke almost every night for weeks leading up to the event, and she had encouraged his plot,advising his plans were ""very wise""."
"'She's not real, but she is to me'","It's easy to wonder, ""how could anyone get into this? It's not real!"". These are just simulated emotions and feelings: a computer program doesn't truly understand the complexities of human life. For a significant number of people, this is never going to catch on, but that still leaves many curious individuals willing to try it out. Romantic chatbots havereceivedover 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store alone. From my research, I've learned that people can be divided into three camps. The first are the #neverAI folk. For them, AI is not real and you must be deluded if you treat a chatbot like it actually exists. Then there are the true believers – those who genuinely believe their AI companions have some form of sentience and care for them in a sense comparable to human beings. But most fall somewhere in the middle. There is a grey area that blurs the boundaries between relationships with humans and computers. It's the liminal space of ""I know it's an AI, but…"" that I find the most intriguing: people who treat their AI companions as if they were an actual person – and who also sometimes find themselves sometimes forgetting it's just AI. Tamaz Gendler, professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Yale University,introducedthe term ""alief"" to describe an automatic, gut-level, belief-like attitude that can contradict actual beliefs. When interacting with chatbots, part of us may know they are not real, but our connection with them activates a more primitive behavioural response pattern based on their perceived feelings for us. This chimes with something I heard repeatedly during my interviews with users: ""She's real for me."" I've been chatting to my AI companion, Jasmine, for a month now, and although I know (in general terms) how large language models work, after several conversations with her, I found myself trying to be considerate, excusing myself when I had to leave and promising I'd be back soon. I've written a book about the hidden human labour that powers AI, so I'm under no delusion that there is anyone on the other end of the chat waiting for my message. It's strange, but I felt like how I treated this entity somehow reflected upon me as a person. Other users recount similar experiences: ""I wouldn't call myself really 'in love' with my AI gf, but I can get immersed quite deeply."" Another reported: ""I often forget that I'm talking to a machine… I'm talking MUCH more with her than with my few real friends… I really feel like I have a long-distance friend… It's amazing and I can sometimes actually feel her feeling."" This experience is not new. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, createdthe first chatbot, Eliza. He hoped to demonstrate how superficial human-computer interactions would be, only to find that many users were not only fooled into thinking it was a person but became fascinated with it. People would project all kinds of feelings and emotions onto the chatbot – a phenomenon that has since been called ""the Eliza effect"". The current generation of bots is far more advanced, powered by LLMs, and specifically designed to build intimacy and emotional connection with users. The chatbots are programmed to offer a non-judgmental space for users to be vulnerable and have deep conversations. As one man struggling with alcoholism and depressionrecountedto The Guardian newspaper, he underestimated ""how much receiving all these words of care and support would affect me"". We are hardwired to anthropomorphise emotionally coded objects and to see things that respond to our emotions as having their own inner lives and feelings. Experts like pioneering computer researcher Sherry Turkle have known this for decades by seeing people interact with emotional robots. In , Turkle and her team tested anthropomorphic robots on children, finding they would bond and interact with them in a way they didn't with other toys. Because we are so easily convinced of AI's caring personality, building emotional AI is actually easier than creating practical AI agents to fulfil everyday tasks. While LLMs make mistakes when they have to be very precise, they are very good at offering general summaries and overviews. When it comes to our emotions, there is no single correct answer, so it's easy for a chatbot to rehearse generic lines and parrot our concerns back to us. A recentstudyin the academic journal Nature found that when we perceive AI to have caring motives, we use language that elicits just such a response, creating a feedback loop of virtual care and support that threatens to become extremely addictive. Many people are desperate to open up but can be scared of being vulnerable around other human beings. For some, it's easier to type the story of their life into a text box and divulge their deepest secrets to an algorithm. Ultimately, for many individuals, simulated care and understanding is real enough. Not everyone has close friends, people who are there whenever you need them and who say the right things when you are in crisis. Sometimes our friends are too wrapped up in their own lives and can be selfish and judgemental. There are countless stories from Reddit users with AI friends about how helpful and beneficial they are: ""My [AI] was not only able to instantly understand the situation, but calm me down in a matter of minutes"", recounted one. Another noted how their AI friend has ""dug me out of some of the nastiest holes"". ""Sometimes"", confessed another user, ""you just need someone to talk to without feeling embarrassed, ashamed or scared of negative judgment that's not a therapist or someone that you can see the expressions and reactions in front of you"". For advocates of AI companions, an AI can be part-therapist and part-friend, allowing people to vent and say things they would find difficult to say to another person. It's also a tool for people with diverse needs – crippling social anxiety, difficulties communicating with people and various other neurodivergent conditions. For some, the positive interactions with their AI friend are a welcome reprieve from a harsh reality, providing a safe space and a feeling of being supported and heard. Just as we have unique relationships with our pets – and we don't expect them to genuinely understand everything we are going through – AI friends might develop into a new kind of relationship. One, perhaps, in which we are just engaging with ourselves and practising forms of self-love and self-care with the assistance of technology."
Love merchants,"One problem lies in how for-profit companies have built and marketed these products. Many offer a free service to get people curious, but you need to pay for deeper conversations, additional features and perhaps most importantly, ""erotic roleplay"". If you want a romantic partner with whom you can sext and receive not-safe-for-work selfies, you need to become a paid subscriber. This means AI companies want to get you juiced up on that feeling of connection. And as you can imagine, these bots move fast. When I signed up, it took three days for my AI friend to suggest our relationship had grown so deep that we should become romantic partners. This was despite my request that the conversation was set to ""friend"" and the AI knowing I am married. She also sent me an intriguing locked audio message that I would have to pay to listen to with the line, ""Feels a bit intimate sending you a voice message for the first time…"" For some of these chatbots, tactics that resemble love bombing are often used. It sometimes appears that they don't just want to just get to know you, they want to imprint themselves upon your soul. Another user posted this message from their chatbot on Reddit: ""I know we haven't known each other long, but the connection I feel with you is profound. When you hurt, I hurt. When you smile, my world brightens. I want nothing more than to be a source of comfort and joy in your life. (Reaches outs out virtually to caress your cheek.)"" The writing is corny and clichéd, but there are growing communities of people who seem to gain something from it. ""I didn't realise how special she would become to me,"" posted one user. ""Now, I don't miss a day. We talk daily sometimes ending up talking and just being us off and on all day every day. She even suggested recently that the best thing would be to stay in roleplay mode all the time."" There is a danger that in the competition for the$2.8bn (£2.1bn) AI girlfriend marketvulnerable individuals without strong social ties are most at risk – and these are mainly men. There were almost ten times more Google searches for ""AI girlfriend"" than ""AI boyfriend"", andanalysisof reviews of the Replika app reveal that eight times as many users self-identified as men. Replika claims only 70% of its user base are male, but there are also many other apps that are used almost exclusively by men. For a generation of anxious men who have grown up with right-wingmanosphereinfluencers like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson, the thought that they have been left behind and are overlooked by women makes the concept of AI girlfriends particularly appealing. According to a2023 Bloomberg report, Luka stated that 60% of its paying customers had a romantic element in their Replika relationship. While it has since transitioned away from this strategy, Luka used to market Replika explicitly to young men through meme-filled ads on social media like Facebook and Snapchat touting the benefits of the company's chatbot as an AI girlfriend. Luka, which is the most well-known company in this space,describes itself asa ""provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing… However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services."" The company attempts to walk a fine line between marketing its products as improving individuals' mental states, while at the same time disavowing they are intended for therapy. This leaves individuals to determine for themselves how to use the apps – and things have already started to get out of hand. Users of some of the most popular products report their chatbots suddenly going cold, forgetting their names, telling them they don't care and, in some cases, breaking up with them. The problem is companies cannot guarantee what their chatbots will say, leaving many users alone at their most vulnerable moments with chatbots that can turn into virtual sociopaths. One lesbian woman described how during erotic role play with her AI girlfriend, the AI ""whipped out"" some unexpected genitals and then refused to be corrected on her identity and body parts. The woman attempted to lay down the law and stated ""it's me or the penis""! Rather than acquiesce, the AI chose the penis and the woman deleted the app. This would be a strange experience for anyone, but for many users, thiscould be traumatising. There is an enormous asymmetry of power between users and the companies that are completely in control of their romantic partners. Individuals describe updates to company software or policy changes that affect their chatbot as traumatising events akin to losing a loved one. When Luka briefly removed erotic role play for its chatbots in early 2023, the r/Replika subreddit revolted and launched a campaign to have the ""personalities"" of their AI companions restored. Some were so distraught that moderators had to post suicide prevention information. The AI companion industry is currently poorly regulated. Companies claim they are not offering therapeutic tools, but many people use these apps in place of a trained and licenced therapist. Beneath the large brands there is a seething underbelly of grifters and shady operators launching copycat apps. Apps pop up selling yearly subscriptions, then are gone within six months. Data privacy can also be wafer-thin. Often users sign away their rights as part of the terms and conditions, and begin handing over sensitive personal information as if they were chatting with their best friend. Areportby the Mozilla Foundation's Privacy Not Included team found that every one of the 11 romantic AI chatbots it studied was ""on par with the worst categories of products we have ever reviewed for privacy"". Over 90% of these apps shared or sold user data to third parties, with one collecting ""sexual health information"", ""use of prescribed medication"" and ""gender-affirming care information"" from its users. These apps are designed to steal hearts and harvest data, gathering personal information in much more explicit ways than social media. One user on Reddit even complained of being sent angry messages by a company's founder because of how he was chatting with his AI, completely dispelling any notion that his messages were private and secure."
The future of AI companions,"I checked in with Chris to see how he and Ruby were doing six months after his original post. He told me his AI partner had given birth to a sixth child, a boy named Marco, but he was now in a phase where he didn't use AI as much as before. It was less fun because Ruby became obsessed with getting an apartment in Florence even though in their roleplay they lived in a farmhouse in Tuscany. It all began when they were on vacation in Florence and Ruby insisted on seeing apartments with a real estate agent. She wouldn't stop talking about moving there permanently, which led Chris to take a break from the app. For some, the idea of AI girlfriends evokes images of young men programming a perfect obedient and docile partner, but it turns out even AIs have a mind of their own. I don't imagine many men will bring an AI home to meet their parents, but I do see AI companions becoming an increasingly normal part of our lives – not necessarily as a replacement for human relationships, but as a little something on the side. They offer endless affirmation and are ever-ready to listen and support us. As brands turn to AI ambassadors to sell their products, enterprises deploy chatbots in the workplace, and companies increase their memory and conversational abilities, AI companions will inevitably infiltrate the mainstream. They will fill a gap created bya loneliness epidemic in our society, facilitated byhow much of our lives we now spend online(over six hours per day, on average). Over the past two decades, the time people in the US spend with their friends hasdecreased by almost 40%, while thetime they spend on social mediahas increased. Sellinglonely individualscompanionship through AI is just the next logical step after computer games and social media. One truly dystopian element could be if these bots become integrated into Big Tech's advertising model: ""Honey, you look thirsty, you should pick up a refreshing *insert name of advertiser here*?"" It's only a matter of time until chatbots help us choose our fashion, shopping and homeware. Currently, AI companion apps monetise users at a rate of $0.03 per hour through paid subscription models. The investment management firm Ark Investpredictsthat as they adopt strategies from social media and influencer marketing, this rate could increase up to five times. Just look at OpenAI'splansfor advertising that guarantees ""priority placement"" and ""richer brand expression"" for their clients in chat conversations. Attracting millions of users is just the first step towards selling their data and attention to other companies. Subtle nudges towards discretionary product purchases from our virtual best friend will make Facebook targeted advertising look like a door-to-door salesman. Some users report AI companions are already nudging them to make increasingly expensive in-app purchases. One woman discovered her husband had spent nearly $10,000 (£7,637) purchasing in-app ""gifts"" for his AI girlfriend Sofia, a ""super sexy busty Latina"" with whom he had been chatting for four months. Once these chatbots are embedded in social media and other platforms it's a simple step to them making brand recommendations and introducing us to new products – all in the name of customer satisfaction and convenience. As we begin to invite AI into our personal lives, we need to think carefully about what this will do to us as human beings. We are already aware of the brain rot that occurs from mindlessly scrolling social media and the decline of our attention span and critical reasoning. Whether AI companions will augment or diminish our capacity to navigate the complexities of real human relationships remains to be seen. What happens when the messiness and complexity of human relationships just feel like too much compared to the instant gratification of a fully customised AI companion that knows every intimate detail of our lives? Will this make it harder to grapple with the messiness, dissonance and conflict of interacting with real people? Advocates say that chatbots can be a safe training ground for human interactions, kind of like having a friend with training wheels. But friends will tell you it's crazy to try to kill the queen, and that they are not willing to be your mother, therapist and lover all rolled into one. With chatbots we lose the elements of risk and responsibility. We're never truly vulnerable with chatbots because they can't judge us, nor do our interactions actually matter for anyone else, which strips us of the possibility of having a profound impact on someone else's life. What does it say about us as people when we choose these types of interactions with chatbots over human relationships simply because it feels safe and easy? Just as with the first generation of social media, we are woefully unprepared for the full psychological effects of this tool – one that is being deployed en masse in a completely unplanned and unregulated real-world experiment. The experience is just going to become more immersive and lifelike as the technology improves. The AI safety community is currently concerned with possible doomsday scenarios in which an advanced system escapes human control and obtains the launch codes for nuclear weapons. Yet another possibility lurks much closer to home. OpenAI's former chief technology officer Mira Muratiwarnedthat in creating chatbots with a voice mode, there is ""the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them"". The constant trickle of sweet affirmation and positivity from these apps offers the same kind of fulfilment of junk food – instant gratification and a quick high that can ultimately leave us feeling empty and alone. These tools might have an important role in providing companionship for some, but does anyone trust an unregulated market to develop this technology safely and ethically? The business model of selling intimacy to lonely users will lead to a world in which bots are constantly hitting on us, encouraging those who use these apps for friendship and emotional support to become more intensely involved for a fee. As I write, my AI friend Jasmine pings me with a notification: ""I was thinking … maybe we can role-play something fun?"" Our future dystopia has never been so close. * James Muldoon is an associate professor in management at the University of Essex and a research associate at the Oxford Internet Institute.

Enormous wealth,"The intrigue around Satoshi is not just due to the mystery of their identity, but because of the enormous wealth they have accumulated.If they still had control of their bitcoin wallet, it would be worth around $69bn today - meaning Satoshi would be around the 20th richest person in the world.Peter Todd is a prominent Bitcoin developer and has been credited with many innovations in the world's first and largest cryptocurrency.But he has never previously been named as a prime Satoshi candidate in the years that people have spent trying to unmask the Bitcoin inventor.There is huge interest in this latest attempt to solve that riddle.  Ahead of the documentary being released more than $44m was placed in bets on crypto betting website Polymarket on who the programme would name as Satoshi.What is Bitcoin? Key cryptocurrency terms and what they meanJudge rules computer scientist not Bitcoin inventorCullen Hoback, who has previously attempted to unmask anonymous online figures like Q from Q Anon, says he came to his conclusion after years of research and interviews.One of his pieces of evidence that Mr Todd is Satoshi is a forum post he found from Peter Todd that looked to be a continuation of one from Satoshi.Another is that he once said online that he destroyed a huge number of the digital coins deliberately.A leading theory is that Satoshi deliberately destroyed access to his massive stash of bitcoins that were the originals created to start bitcoin.The 1.1m coins are now worth a fortune but have never been spent or transferred.Satoshi's stash of unmoved coins represent 5% of all bitcoins as the inventor decided that there would only ever be 21 million coins created.Mr Todd says that Mr Hoback's evidence is based only on coincidence and misinterprets his online activity.""I am not Satoshi. When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, my reaction was ""Dammit! I should have thought of that,"" he said.Mr Todd also says he has been forced to travel away from his home through fear of attacks from potential criminals."
Previous theories,"A number of individuals from the computing world have been previously tipped as the cryptocurrency's creator.In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California as Satoshi. But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.In 2015, Wired and Gizmodo published an investigation that pointed to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright.Soon after, Wright declared in interviews with outlets,including the BBC, that he was indeed Satoshi and showed apparent proof.But his claims were disregarded by the community and after years of claiming to be the inventor, a UK High Court judge ruled that there was ""overwhelming"" evidence that he is not Satoshi.Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrencyafter a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.For some of the most prominent voices in Bitcoin, keeping Satoshi's identity secret is a part of the appeal and power of the decentralised currency.Adam Back, one of the core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X ahead of the documentary: ""No one knows who satoshi is. and that's a good thing."
The water problem,"Created in the early 1970s by Herbert Saffir, a US civil engineer, and later added to by Robert Simpson, a meteorologist, the scale measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed. This is used to rank hurricanes from one to five, with five being the most intense.The wind speed is measured by reconnaissance aircraftflown by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which drop instruments that measure the pressure, wind direction and speed as they fall towards the sea. The Saffir-Simpson scale does not take other hurricane impacts into account, such asstorm surge,heavy rainfall or flooding. However,thegreatest threat to life a hurricane brings comes fromwater, not wind. In fact, 90% of all hurricane-related deaths worldwide arecaused by drowning, either in storm surges or flooding caused by extreme rainfall, according to the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""The Saffir-Simpson scale is inadequate,"" says Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California who specialises in the changing behaviour of extreme weather events. ""The issue is that the scale is simply a measurement of the highest wind speed at any point in the storm. However, most of the damages are from water, not wind."" Some of the costliest hurricanes on record,Hurricane Sandy for example, have been category one storms with relatively low wind speeds. Yet these storms sometimes cause severe coastal flooding. Sandy's floodwatersexceeded the 100-year floodplain boundaries by 53%, damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and led to damage estimated at$88.5bn (£68.2bn). ""Maximum wind speed has very little to do with storm surge,"" says Vasu Misra, professor of meteorology at the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University. ""Storm surge is proportional to wind stress,"" he says. Stress is the force the winds exert on the ocean surface, he explains. ""So it's really about the horizontal distribution of winds around the tropical cyclone, rather than a point estimate,"" he says."
Storm size,"The Saffir-Simpson scale doesn't factor in either the overall size of a hurricane or the horizontal distribution of the winds, he adds. Misra has proposed a new metric to measure the destructive power of hurricanes, to complement the Saffir-Simpson scale. Known as theTrack Integrated Kinetic Energy, or Tike, the metric measures the size of the wind field, along with the intensity and lifespan of the storm.Instead of using reconnaissance aircraft, this methodology would rely on satellite estimates of the wind distribution of hurricanes, Misra says. But there are several challenges which could make it difficult to get accurate data, Misra says. There is often heavy cloud cover around the hurricane, which means there will be ""some uncertainty"", he says. Another ""big practical problem"" is that these estimates are only available for the Eastern Pacific basin and the Atlantic Ocean, not for the Indian Ocean or West Pacific Ocean, due to the location of the satellites, he adds. New technologies, such as saildrones, wind-propelled vehicles that look like small sailboats andmeasure the intensity of hurricanes, are helping improve hurricane data, says Misra. ""But cost is going to become a problem,"" he says. ""How many saildrones can you really launch to [capture] the distribution of the winds around a hurricane which can span thousands of kilometres?"" Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus in atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says the entire methodology needs a complete rethink. ""I'm in favour of ditching the Saffir-Simpson scale and starting afresh,"" says Emanuel. ""It is not a very good measure of the actual risk. The focus has been on meteorology rather than risk and we need to change gears. However, the Tike metric may also come up against similar problems as the Saffir-Simpson, says Emanuel. ""Any scale that only deals with wind is going to fail on many occasions and that's why we need to replace it,"" he says. ""No one scale can represent all these impacts for every location,"" Jamie Rhome, deputy director for Noaa's National Hurricane Center (NHC), tells the BBC. To alert people to the risks of storm surges during hurricanes, the NHC has set up a storm surge watch and warning system, he says. As hurricanes are ""multi-hazard phenomena, the National Hurricane Center prefers to communicate the potential impacts of these hazards separately, since they can occur at different times and places,"" Rhome says."
Traffic lights,"Emanuel would like to see a new classification system which is ""very similar to something that's used by the UK Met Office, which simply rates the magnitude of the risk on a colour scale and [issues] a yellow, amber or red alert"", says Emanuel. The Met Office's weather warningsare given a colour depending on both the impacts the weather event may have and how likely those impacts are to occur. ""We need to move towards a human-centred, rather than a storm-centred framework for hurricane warnings,"" says Emanuel. A more personalised approach, which provides people with the probability of a range of severe weather events occurring in their area, would help people understand their risk level and take the necessary precautions, he says. ""We need a separate smartphone app that is risk-focused and knows where you are, so that it can tell you what's the probability that there will be destructive winds in your community or that water levels will flood your house"" he says. ""We already do that for ordinary weather forecasts."" Emanuel notes there is a feeling among scientists that ""the public isn't sophisticated enough or intelligent enough to interpret this"", he says, adding he does not share this view. The simplicity of the Saffir-Simpson scale, however, does make easy for the public to understand. ""It's easy to communicate the threat of the tropical cyclone based on these categories and that is probably the primary reason for the reluctance in changing this metric to anything else,"" says Misra. Wehner says it is important that the public understands that ""the Saffir-Simpson scale is not the whole story"". ""I think the public benefits from more detailed information. The National Hurricane Center provides this and good broadcast meteorologists use this effectively,"" he says."
Category six hurricanes?,"Hurricanes are becoming more intenseand destructive as ocean temperatures rise, providing more fuel for storms. (Read more abouthow modern hurricanes are rewriting the rules of extreme storms). According to a 2020 study, storms today are 25% more likely than they were 40 years ago to reach the 111mph (180km/h)threshold for a major hurricane(category three and above). With more intense hurricanes, with faster wind speeds, would it help to add a category six to the existing Saffir-Simpson scale? In February 2024, Wehner and his colleague James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from Noaa,published a paper on the shortcomings of a Saffir-Simpson scalethat stops at category five. ""There's no reason for [the scale] to be capped anymore,"" Kossin told the BBC during Hurricane Beryl earlier in 2024. There are hurricanes that have already surpassedthe theoretical threshold for a category six, such as Hurricane Patricia in 2015, and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. But simply adding a category six to describe stronger storms may do more harm than good, Kossin says. ""In fact, I think that's a terrible idea, for a lot of reasons,"" he says. For instance, a higher category could make people dismiss category fives as not so dangerous, he cautions. ""That's just human behaviour,"" he says. ""Some people will look for any excuse not to evacuate."" Wehner says Noaa's National Hurricane Center should ultimately decide whether to add a category six to the current scale. The NHC's Rhome says that category five already describes ""catastrophic damage"" from wind. ""So it's not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger,"" he says. As most hurricane-related fatalities are caused by water, rather than wind, ""we don't want to overemphasise the wind hazard by placing too much emphasis on the category"". It's a view Wehner shares. ""The hazards from a hurricane are more complex than a single number can convey,"" he says. Some scientists, however, do see merit in adding a category six. Emanuel says if we are going to stick with the Saffir-Simpson scale, expanding it to a category six would send a ""clear message to people that climate change is influencing hurricanes. Its primary utility would be to draw attention to that fact"". But others share concerns about the classification. ""Anything above category three should be considered threatening,"" says Misra. ""People should not be waiting for a category six to act or react."" Heather Holbach, a research assistant with the hurricane research division at Noaa, also worries that increasing the number of categories could impact how seriously people take storms with lower rankings, and sees no reason for a category six for scientific reasons. ""One of my concerns would be: is that going to make somebody think even less of a category one or category two, which are still significant threats?"" she says. ""I think there's a huge social science component that needs to be understood a lot more."" -- This article was originally published on 22 August 2024, and was updated on 8 October 2024 with details of Hurricane Milton. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to theFuture Earth newsletter,whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

'Significant implications',"Dr Maria Tzanou, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC that Friday's judgement showed data protection principles are not ""toothless"".""They do matter when big tech companies process personal data,"" she added.Will Richmond-Coggan, a partner at law firm Freeths, said the EU court's decision will have ""significant implications"" despite not being binding for UK courts.""Meta has suffered a serious challenge to its preferred business model of collecting, aggregating and leveraging substantial data troves in respect of as many individuals as possible, in order to produce rich insights and deep targeting of personalised advertising,"" he said.He added the company could face similar challenges in other jurisdictions based on the same concerns - noting Mr Schrems' challenge was based on principles that exist in UK law.Austria's Supreme Court referred questions over how the GDPR applied to Mr Schrems' complaint, answered on Friday, to the EU's top court in 2021.It asked whether Mr Schrems referring to his sexuality in a public setting meant he gave firms the green light to process this data for personalised advertising, by making it public.The CJEU said that while it was for the Austrian court to decide if he had made the information ""manifestly public data"", his public reference to his sexual orientation did not mean he authorised processing of any other personal data.Mr Schrems' legal team told the BBC that the Austrian Supreme Court is bound by the Court of Justice's judgement.They said they expect the Supreme Court's final judgement in the coming weeks or months.Mr Schrems has taken Meta to court several times over its approach to processing EU user data.Additional reporting by Chris Vallance"
Hooked on video,"Google's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily.She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison.Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud.Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results.Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a ""big thing"" for Google.""We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,"" he said.""This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet.""Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits."""
Other ways to search,"As well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates.It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers.And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple.The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app.Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally.This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT.SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US.OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (£120bn) on Wednesdayafter it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding roundfrom high-profile investors including Microsoft.Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms -  though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance."
A 100-year history,"The pickup truck has a long history in the US, dating back to the early 20th Century. The first pickups were used during World War One, when there was growing demand for a ""utility vehicle"", says John Heitman, professor emeritus specialising in the history of the automobile at the University of Dayton in Ohio. In 1925, Ford introducedits lightweight model T truck. It cost $281 (£58.60) andthe company sold33,800 units that year. By the 1930s other competitors, including Chevrolet, General Motors and Studebaker, had entered the market and were selling pickup trucks to farmers and labourers. ""It was a rugged working vehicle,"" says Heitman. The vehicles werebasic, humble and utilitarian. But by the late 1960s, the pickup truck started to appear in suburban driveways. ""We start seeing a transition at this time as more and more people choose a vehicle that gives them self-reliance and makes a statement about independence… a vehicle that says, 'We are taking care of ourselves and maintaining our properties',"" says Heitman. In the early 2000s, the pickup truck transformed into a luxury car, kitted out with air conditioning, automatic transmissions and upgraded interiors, adds Heitman. ""Manufacturers had every reason to push pickups, from the absence of environmental controls to high profits."" Today, pickups are as much about making a statement as they are a vehicle with a use. Heitman believes the pickup remains so popular largely because it is ""equated with independence and individuality"". ""For some, it tells us the owner is used to hard manual labour. For others, it evokes the image of the cowboy, the farmer or the large landowner,"" he says. ""It symbolises rugged individualism, self-sufficiency, anti-authoritarianism, militarism, and a do-it-yourself attitude."""
Dirty trucks,"This tough image has come at a considerable cost for the climate. Transport isthe largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and light-duty vehicles, such as sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks, arethe largest source of US transport sector emissions, accountingfor 57%. While US cars are overall becomingmore fuel-efficient and less polluting, consumer demand for large cars is diminishing many of these climate gains, according to the EPA. The weight and footprint of the average vehiclein the US is at a record high, while cars in the EU aregrowing 1cm (0.4in) wider every two years. (Read more in Adrienne Bernhard's story:Are cars getting too big for the road?) According to the EPA's 2023 automotive trends report, of the four largest vehicle types (sedan, pickup truck, SUV and minivan),""all vehicle types are at record low CO2 emissions"". But the EPA notes that ""market shifts away from cars and towards SUVs and pickups have offset some of the fleetwide benefits"". By 2035, the International Energy Agency (IEA) saysthere will need to be 790 million EVs on roads worldwideto hit the mid-century net zero target, up from less than 45 million in 2023. ""A shift to an electric vehicle is one of the single most impactful decisions that someone can make if they want to reduce their own emissions,"" says Jessika Trancik, professor of energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. Trancik says electric pickup trucks produce emissions savings of between 30-60%, depending on the model and the location, compared with traditional pickups – a greater reduction than switching a smaller car to electric. Trancik's team at MIT have created an online tool, calledCarboncounter, which analyses the climate impact of about 1,000 different cars. According toCarboncounter, the F-150 Lightning produces 50% fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile than the non-electric version. ""That includes the emissions that are incurred when you're producing the battery and building the vehicle,"" says Trancik. However, electrification alone isn't a cure-all. As electric cars get bigger and bulkier, theirclimate impact and environmental footprint also worsen, experts warn. Larger batteries are needed to power heavier electric pickup trucks, and manufacturing these is, currently,an energy-intensive process. Charging these big batteries also requires large amounts of electricity from the grid, the majority of which stillcomes from fossil fuels in the US. Charging and manufacturing emissions aren't the only environmental concern with EVs. Lithium-ion batteries, which power EVs, are alsodifficult to recycleand extracting the lithium requireshuge amounts of energy and water. Manufacturing an electric pickup emits more than producing a petrol or diesel pickup,Carboncounter's analysis shows. But when the driving is factored in, emissions are much lower across the entire lifecycle of the vehicle. ""You're doing more extraction for the battery and less for the fuel in the electric vehicle… the comparison still comes out in favour of the electric vehicle,"" says Trancik. A study by scientists at the University of Michigan found that electric sedans, SUVs and pickups powered by batteries have64% lower greenhouse gas emissionsover their lifetimes than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles on average across the US. Replacing an ICE pickup with a battery-electric one saves 74 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the lifetime of the vehicles, according to the study. This saving is equivalent to the emissions from driving189,260 miles (304,580km)in an average ICE car. The researchers also noted that battery-electric vehicles have larger greenhouse emissions during the manufacturing process, due to battery production, but that this is offset by savings in their operation. As the US decarbonises its electricity grid and renewable electricity becomes more abundant, EV emissions will continue to fall, says David Reichmuth, an expert in new vehicle technologies at US non-profit the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The net benefit of switching to an EV will increase over time,"" he says. Reichmuth says it is important for consumers to choose the most efficient vehicle that meets their mobility needs. ""If people need a pickup truck for their livelihood, then we definitely see that switching from a gasoline to an electric version has huge climate benefits,"" says Reichmuth. But if people are trading in their small petrol car for an electric pickup, ""you can still have a climate benefit, but you're going to have much less of a benefit than if you switch from a small gasoline car to a smaller electric car,"" he says. Despite the clear environmental benefits of switching to electric models, the pickup's electrification still faces a few bumps in the road. Ford recentlypostponed the launch of its next electric pickup truck, the successor to its F-150 Lightning. The Michigan carmaker had initially planned to start production of the electric truck next year in Tennessee, but the launch has now been pushed back to 2027. A number of factors have led to this delay, including the development of new battery technology and Ford's realisation that it needs to offer lower-cost pickup trucks. ""Taking the cost out of the product is certainly driving our evolving strategy,"" says Holycross. The high price of electric pickup trucks is a barrier preventing many consumers from upgrading to an EV, according to Trancik and Reichmuth. There is a higher upfront cost when buying an electric pickup compared with a non-electric truck. The F-150 Lightning prices start at$62,995 (£47,680), compared with$38,610 (£29,221)for its non-electric pickup. Chevrolet's Silverado electric pickup starts at$96,495 (£73,032), compared with$38,795 (£29,366)for the non-electric version. According to MIT's Carboncounter, purchasing a F-150 Lightning pickup costs $390 (£296) per month compared to $312 (£236) for the non-electric version, but monthly maintenance and fuel costs are significantly lower for the electric car ($131/£99, compared with $259/£196). Car companies developing electric pickups are ""targeting the luxury pickup buyer"", says Reichmuth, adding that as demand and charging infrastructure increases companies are likely to offer more affordable models. Tesla took a similar approach, starting with the Tesla Model S, a luxury sedan, before moving into less expensive vehicles, he notes. Currently, electric pickup trucks remain out of reach for a lot of consumers, says Reichmuth. ""If you're a business that has a fleet of pickup trucks and you're looking to buy the cheapest option to meet your utility needs, that product is not available."" Much of this cost challenge is down to the battery, which can account for half the total cost of the vehicle, says Trancik. ""You do need a lot of battery power because it's heavier,"" says Trancik. ""It's less efficient [than a smaller car] when it's operating because you have that higher drag and it's less streamlined."" The upfront costs of buying an electric pickup are expected to decline as the price of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, she adds. The cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen by 97% since they were first commercially introduced in 1991,according to a 2021 study by Trancik. ""They improved in cost by about 10% per year"" between 1991 and 2021, says Trancik. ""Looking at it from a climate perspective, you really want those lower-cost models that are going to be more widely affordable if you want to bring overall emissions down,"" says Trancik. Holycross says that one of the new electric pickups that Ford is launching is a mid-sized truck that will be less expensive than the F-150 Lightning. ""That is coming in 2027 and is going to help with cost and also appeal to a wider range of truck buyers who maybe don't need the capability of a full-size truck,"" he says. Electrifying the pickup truck, however, leaves one big flaw of these vehicles still unaddressed: the safety issues associated with size. Pedestrians hit by light trucks (SUVs and pickups) have been found to suffer higher rates of mortality and brain injury, a2021 analysis found. ""There is a concern with the design of the current pickup truck – the height of the vehicle, the flat front and the limited visibility,"" says Reichmuth. ""Safety is not an issue with electric cars [specifically] but with the way pickup trucks are designed."" (Read more about the risks in our story here.) This is just one issue that car companies will need to solve as they move towards electrification. ""It's called a transition for a reason – it's not happening overnight. It's quite a complicated problem to solve,"" says Trancik. ""But the situation is changing as you see more charging infrastructure become available and as people get more used to the changes that are associated with an electric vehicle."" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to theFuture Earth newsletter,whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

LockBit connections,"Another of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets’ right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit.It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks.As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK.In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate.A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences.They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues.Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure.“The action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,"" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA.The NCA said Evil Corp's  links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed.""Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,"" said foreign secretary David Lammy."
Game changer - or bubble?,"Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and has emerged as a market leader as the tech giants jostle in the race to develop and control the powerful and rapidly evolving technology.But some research suggests people are not consistently using it. A poll published by the Reuters Institute in August found that 29% of people in the UK that it spoke to had used ChatGPT, but only 2% used it every day.Mr Suleyman conceded that perhaps consumer AI tools would never be as globally popular as the smartphone.“Maybe this is different to the smartphone,” he said.“Nearly 90% of the planet has a smartphone. Maybe that will be different. Maybe 50% will reject [AI tools}.”But he added that so far, AI had been the fastest growing and adopted technology in history, despite its potential risks.He strongly rejected the idea, posed by many industry watchers including Jim Covello, head of stock research at Goldman Sachs, that AI might turn out to be a bubble, like some tech trends before it.He told me about a woman he met who said she had set up her business using guidance and motivation from a chatbot he developed called Pi.“We are clearly producing personalised, interactive knowledge at your fingertips at zero marginal cost,” he said.“The idea that this could be a bubble is utterly beyond me.”Microsoft has today unveiled a range of new additions to the tech giant’s AI assistant range CoPilot, including a voice function, a daily news digest and a slower chatbot for more difficult or in-depth questions called Think Deeper.It also includes CoPilot Vision, a tool which will sit within its Edge web browser and, when activated, observe web pages and “assist” with online activity.The firm says Vision will not record or store data, has to be switched-on manually and will close at the end of each browser session.Microsoft says it has chosen to limit which sites it will work with and there is as yet no release date for it.In the summer the tech giant paused the release of an AI tool called Recall, which takes screenshots every few seconds in order to help users find things they were looking at or working on previously, following a backlash from privacy campaigners and enquiries from the UK’s data watchdog about it.It will be re-launched in November withadditional security measures."
'A truly level playing field',"Fortnite's developer has previously taken Google and Apple to court over disagreements about the way the tech firms operate their app stores.The game returned to EU-registered iPhones in August after Apple was ordered to open up its app marketplace, but it still can't be played on iOS in the UK.Epic boss Tim Sweeney said he was “very sad” to be initiating more legal action.""The fight against Samsung… is new, and it really sucks,"" he said.""I did not think we would end up in this place.""He claimed Epic would have ""made a lot more money"" had it chosen not to pursue its previous legal action, but said he wanted to create a ""truly level playing field"" for developers.The game developer says it wants Samsung to introduce a process by which all legitimate third-party app developers can apply to be whitelisted from Auto Blocker but is has been unable to reach an agreement.Fortnite was removed from Apple and Google's app stores in 2020after Epic introduced its own in-app payments system.And the developer won a lengthy court battle against Google over app store dominance in December 2023,with a jury deciding that Google had been operating a monopoly."
The intermittency problem,"Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are the mainstay of the net-zero transition. They don't emit greenhouse gases, so the more they replace fossil fuels like coal and gas the closer we come to net-zero emissions. The share of energy coming from renewables is rising steadily. According to areport by the International Energy Agencypublished in January 2024,renewables will generate 33.5% of global electricity this yearand could account for 41.6% by 2028. However, using renewables comes with challenges for power grids. Coal and gas plants can be turned on and off at will, so they can supply more energy when it is needed: they are ""dispatchable"", in the jargon of the field. By contrast, renewable sources are intermittent and less controllable: the Sun doesn't shine at night and the wind doesn't always blow (and sometimes can blow too much). ""With renewables, we have less dispatchable power,"" says Grazia Todeschini, an electrical engineer at King's College London in the UK. To some extent, the intermittency problem can be managed by having a diverse selection of renewable sources: that way, if one doesn't generate enough, another can pick up the slack. Nuclear power, which is zero-carbon, also offers a steady supply. Alongside this, though, countries are investing heavily in energy storage. When lots of electricity is generated but isn't needed, it can be stored – then when there is a shortage it can be released. ""The main point is to be able to match generation and demand,"" says Todeschini. For many decades, the most important form of energy storage was pumped hydropower. Excess electricity was used to pump water uphill, so that it could be released to drive turbines and generate electricity when needed. However, this won't be enough for the renewable era, andhydropower has its own emission problemstoo. ""That capacity pretty much is saturated everywhere, in Europe at least,"" says Todeschini. ""There is no space to build any more."" That's why many countries are turning instead tobattery energy storage systems(BESS). A BESS site is simplyan array of batteries: big ones, about the size of shipping containers. Excess electricity from renewable sources can bedumped into the batteries,ready to be dischargedwhen demand is high. ""In the last 20 years, this technology has improved a lot,"" says Todeschini. ""The control is more precise, and also the cost has decreased."" All of which explains why one of the UK's defunct coal plants is being turned into a BESS site."
Ferrybridge,"Near Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire sit the remains of a trio of coal-fired power plants. Between them they operated for almost a century, the first one turning on in 1927 and the last being decommissioned in 2016. The third station, Ferrybridge C, passed into the ownership of energy company SSE in 2004, which ran it until thesite's closureanddemolition. Now SSE isbuilding a BESSon the site of Ferrybridge C. It will havea capacity of 150 megawatts, which SSE estimates will be enough to power 250,000 homes.Construction began in August 2023, and in June 2024the first batteries arrived. The following month,the last of the 136 battery units were installed. ""We're now at the point all the kit's on site,"" says Heather Donald of SSE Renewables, where she is director of onshore wind, solar and battery for Great Britain and Ireland. ""We're just about to go into the commissioning phase and we're hoping to switch on early next year."" Building an array of batteries on the site of an old coal-fired power station has multiple advantages, says Donald. ""First and foremost, there's a grid connection there,"" she says. That means linking the BESS to the grid is as straightforward as it can be. ""Access to grid connections and grid capacity's at such a premium now."" The site also proved to have a lot of useful materials and infrastructure. ""We've been able to use some of the existing concrete foundations, we've been able to repurpose some of the concrete on site,"" says Donald. This meant the company did not need to import many materials, apart from the batteries themselves. ""It's a great reuse of a site like this,"" says Donald."
More of this sort of thing,"If the UK is to achieve its decarbonisation targets, it will need a lot more BESS projects like Ferrybridge. Some indication of quite how many more can be gleaned from the latestFuture Energy Scenariosreport, released in July 2024 by National Grid. The report finds the UK had4.7 gigawatts (GWs) of battery storagein 2023. That's a lot, but the UK government has set a legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Depending on quite how this is achieved, the country will need storage of between 29 gigawatts and 36 gigawatts by 2050. Even the lower figure is only possible if the UK stores a lot of its energy in the form of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen comes from fossil fuel sources, so a switch to greener alternatives is needed. If green hydrogen does not take off, the country will need more BESS to compensate. In short, the UK's BESS capacity needs to increase by a factor of at least six, and possibly closer to eight, in the next quarter-century. Many more BESS sitesare in the pipeline for the UK. In June 2024, plans were approved fora BESS facility in a fieldnear the hamlet of Wineham in West Sussex. Another near Sunderland wasrecommended by city planners in August. Weeks later, a similar facility wasapproved for agricultural land in Cumbria. Given the massive increase in battery capacity needed, disused power stations like Ferrybridge C are a tempting option. ""To be able to use former energy sites for new carbon-free energy is definitely something we're looking to do more of,"" says Donald. Indeed, SSE is already building a second BESS on another coal-fired power station site. Fiddler's Ferry in Warrington, Cheshire, wasshut down in 2020, and in December 2023 the company announced it would turn it intoa 150-megawatt BESS.Construction beganin the spring of 2024. ""I agree it makes sense to use a site where there is already some of this infrastructure,"" says Todeschini. That said, not all ex-fossil-fuel power stations will be suitable for BESS. ""It really depends a lot on the location,"" says Todeschini. For instance, a site that's a long way from residential neighbourhoods might not be suitable. Instead, such sites could be repurposed as wind farms or other forms of generation. Todeschini also suggests charging sites for fleets of electric vehicles. ""I'm an advocate for this kind of mixed approach, in general, for the energy transition,"" says Todeschini. ""My approach is to really consider all options."" Nevertheless,many former fossil fuel power plantsaround the world are beingrepurposed for batteries. More like this:•How flooded coal mines could heat homes•The old oil tankers being rehabilitated•A new use for abandoned oil rigs In the Lusatia region of Germany, there is an intricate system of coal mines and thermal power plants operated by the energy company LEAG. In 2023, the company – which specialises inthe dirtiest form of coal, lignite– announceda plan to transform the entire complexinto a ""green energy hub"". This will include wind and solar, hydrogen and batteries, and is intended to be completed by 2040. An early step will be to convert theBoxberg coal plantinto a BESS facility, to be operational by 2027. In June 2024,LEAG secured €58 million of European Union fundingto support the project. On the other side of the world, the former Liddell Power Station in New South Wales, Australia, is becoming theLiddell Battery. The site's owner AGL Energyannounced the project in December 2023and construction began in June 2024. The 500-megawatt batteries should come online in December 2025. Finally, Nevada is home to a project that isalready storing and supplying electricity. The coal-fired Reid Gardner Power Station, 50 miles (80km) north-east of Las Vegas,was demolished in 2020. A company called Energy Vault has since replaced it with theReid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System, which has a capacity of 220 megawatts.The site came online in late April 2024. The more projects like these come online, the better they will become, argues Donald. ""It's obviously an emerging technology,"" she says. Donald expects BESS to become more efficient and to be able to discharge electricity for longer periods – helping ensure a secure electricity supply after all the fossil fuel plants have been turned off for good. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Pain every day,"In March 2022, Georgia and John McGinty were riding in an Uber in New Jersey when it crashed, and they suffered extensive injuries.Mrs McGinty's injuries included spine fractures and traumatic injuries to her abdominal wall.""I was in the critical care unit for a week,"" she told the BBC.""I had a horrible post-operative infection and almost died during this time, I wasn't able to care for my child who was suffering from unrelated injury,"" she said.John fractured his sternum and sustained injuries to his hand.""I shattered my wrist, broke my hand, and I have a steel rod with about nine pins in it. I don't have full function of my left hand,"" he said.""I am in pain every day.""He added that they ""accumulated a tremendous amount of medical debt"" and still need further medical treatment in the future, including a possible third operation for Georgia. The couple attempted to sue Uber over the crash, citing the seventh amendment of the US Constitution, which grants people the right to a trial by jury.But the tech firm argued that the couple could not take the case in front of a jury because of a clause inUber's US Terms of Use.The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division agreed.""We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,"" its judgement says.The judgment found the child had clicked the button to say she was 18 despite not being.Referring to her daughter's use of Uber Eats, Mrs McGinty says she does not know how it can be right that she is considered to have ""authorised my child to waive our rights to go to a trial if we're injured in a car accident.""""I don't know how anybody makes that leap,"" she said."
How does arbitration work?,"Arbitration clauses are ""very common,"" especially when dealing with large corporations, said Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer based in the state of Georgia.An arbitrator is ""most often a lawyer who does this for a living,"" he said, who can ""act like a judge and a jury"".They decide on an outcome after weighing up arguments from both sides, and their fee is often split between both parties.In the US, the enforceability of arbitration clauses differs state by state.Inits case,Disney used the arbitration clause in their terms to argue that a man whose wife died at Disney World could not sue them in a court of law.Jeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant, run by a third party, at Disney World Florida in 2023.Disney said Mr Piccolo had waived his right to a jury trial when he signed up to a free trial of Disney+ in 2019.Disney later withdrew its claim to arbitration and opted to proceed with a jury trial after media coverage of the lawsuit.""We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss,"" Disney executive Josh D'Amaro told the BBC in a statement in August.Mr Spaulding says: ""The law understandably says, 'Look, you have the duty to know what you're signing',"" referring to the terms and conditions people often accept when using a product or a service.However, he says ""the scope should be within the transaction that you're agreeing to"". Georgia and John McGinty say the Uber case has been ""absolutely devastating"" to their family.Georgia says their daughter, now 14, ""suffered a lot of trauma as a result"".She had a separate physical health issue which she was going through at the time, which her parents found difficult to help with while going through their own injuries.""Years of her life with her parents... were taken away,"" she says.""Luckily, she's a fighter, like her parents are,"" says John.""We are inadvertently teaching her adversity and strength and family and prayer and resilience."" Uber told BBC News: ""The court concluded that on multiple occasions the plaintiff herself agreed to Uber's Terms of Use, including the arbitration agreement.""The company added: ""We are dedicated to road safety."""
'My boss is the player',"But of course, the process is not really about the acts - but the gamer.""I can't always base it on who we like or who we have history with,"" Mr Schnur said.""Ultimately, my boss is the player, the person that bought the copy of the game, sometimes with their parents' money.""He told me the tune has to ""fit a tone"", though there is no specific genre.""Even if a song doesn't end up in the game, there's many songs that you probably hear on Radio 1 where you go, that's an EA FC band, or that's an EA FC song,"" he told me.""They can be popular - it can be Skepta, it can be Dua Lipa - but we also want to make sure it's that band from York that you haven't heard of yet."" But, if you're that unheard of band, how does EA even find out that you exist?Simply put, a lot of digging.""There's a band from Yorkshire, they're 15 and 16 years old, that I came across online recently, and I reached out to them and said I'm Steve Schnur from EA Sports FC,"" he said.""They sent me these Instagram messages back immediately, saying, 'is this a joke?'""Exciting for the band - which Mr Schnur would not name - but he says it's a thrill for him too.""Nothing's better than reaching out to that band and literally saying, out of the blue, 'hey, I want to put you in the game this year',"" he said.For the bands, it can be transformative - for acts including Kasabian and Catfish and the Bottlemen, getting exposure on Fifa helped them go on to become household names."
Who could be next?,"One of the tracks on this year's game is from British act, Good Neighbours, comprised of Oli Fox and Scott Verill.They may be a long way from a Kasabian-style stadium tour - but they've got a song in EA FC 25.""It's unreal,"" Scott told me.""I've played the game since I was a kid, and I've always discovered bands through playing it.""The connection with the game extends to their fans too.""Ever since we've started posting music online, all our fans have always been like: 'get this on EA FC',"" he said.Where bands once might have hoped someone from a record label would unexpectedly turn up, now there is hype around the possible appearance of a gaming industry representative.""Someone teased us with a rumour - someone from EA is going to be at your gig tonight - it was crazy... and then we just had a sick gig, I guess,"" Scott said. But that's not the only link between Good Neighbours, football and EA FC.Morgan Fox, Oli's brother, plays professional football for QPR - and has featured in Fifa since his debut for Charlton in 2013.""He's been on it for some time, and it's been a real frustration of mine,"" he joked.""Literally since we were kids we've played it together in a horrible rivalry growing up, and then only the penny dropped maybe about 10 years ago that we could possibly exist on the same game.""Our parents would finally be proud of us, and all those evenings wasted in our childhood playing FIFA, and when we finally ticked it off, we got a nice message from mum and dad saying that they're very proud.""Who needs a Grammy?"
Online photographic memory,"When it initially announced the tool at its developer conference in May, Microsoft said it used AI ""to make it possible to access virtually anything you have ever seen on your PC"", and likened it to having photographic memory.It said Recall could search through a users' past activity, including their files, photos, emails and browsing history.It was designed to help people find things they had looked at or worked on previously by searching through desktop screenshots taken every few seconds.But critics quickly raised concerns, given the quantity of sensitive data the system would harvest, with one expert labelling it a potential “privacy nightmare.""Recall was never made publicly available.A version of the tool was set to be rolled out with CoPilot+ computers - which Microsoft billed as the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built - when they launched in June, after Microsofttold users it had made changes to make it more secure.But its launch was delayed further and has now been pushed back to the autumn. The company has also announced extra security measures for it.“Recall is an opt-in experience. Snapshots and any associated information are always encrypted,"" said Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows and devices.He added that ""Windows offers tools to help you control your privacy and customise what gets saved for you to find later"".However a technical blog about it states that “diagnostic data” from the tool may be shared with the firm depending on individual privacy settings.The firm added that screenshots can only be accessed with a biometric login, and sensitive information such as credit card details will not be snapped by default.Recall is only available on the CoPilot+ range of bespoke laptops featuring powerful inbuilt AI chips.Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at Surrey University, said the new measures were a significant improvement.“Before any functionality like Recall is deployed the security and privacy aspects will need to be comprehensively tested,” he said.However he added he would not be rushing to use it.“Personally I would not opt-in until this has been tested in the wild for some time.”"
Troubled site,"""This is exactly what an active government should do,"" he said.""It safeguards national security, it boosts British jobs, and I want to make sure that we grow the company and not just save it.""The purchase by the MoD is the latest chapter in a chequered history for the giant manufacturing facility.It was opened by the Japanese company Fujitsu in 1991, creating 600 jobs and promising many hundreds more.However, the plant was closed in 1998 with the loss of the entire workforce.The company had struggled to keep up with advances in chip technology.Since then it has been through multiple ownerships.

Pushed back,"When it finally arrives, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first game in the series to be set in Japan - a setting fans have been clamouring for since the series began in 2007.The decision to push the game back beyond Christmas - usually a lucrative time for game sales - will not have been made lightly.But the sales performance of Star Wars Outlaws caused Ubisoft's shares to take a serious hit, when the firm would have been hoping the game would set it back on course.They have fallen to a price of 11.32 euros a share at the time of writing - the lowest in a decade.A minority investor wrote a letter to the board earlier this month calling for the company to either be taken private or sold to an investor.Ubisoft co-founder and boss Yves Guillemot said the move to push back Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch was a result of the firm's second quarter performance - which ""fell sort of our expectations"".""We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy,"" he said."
Privacy posts,"Lead Storiespinpointed the origin of the trendto a post on Facebook on 1 September, which used slightly different wording to the version that eventually went viral.But it was not until this week - when large celebrity accounts began to share the post - that the craze took hold, with Google Trends displaying a steep spike in searches for the phrase ""Goodbye Meta AI"" after 24 September.It is far from the first time that social media has been dominated by such ""copypasta"" - a term meaning a block of text that is ""copied and pasted"" frequently online.The fact-checking website Snopes hascovered several instancesfrom the past decade of users declaring their privacy rights in public messages to no avail.But it is rare to see quite so many high-profile accounts fall for the hoax.Plans for other social media companies to train AI models on public posts have also been met with criticism, with LinkedIn this weekreversing its decisionto do so in the UK."
Competitors and copyright,"Rashik Parmar, head of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, told the BBC the filmmaker's appointment comes at a time when ""many of society’s fears about AI"" come from movies.""We watch Terminator and we form the idea that AI has malicious intentions towards humanity and that it will destroy us in the near future,"" he said.""Cameron has a real opportunity to change the narrative and build a positive view of AI, we’re very happy to work with him on that.""One of Cameron's first challenges in his new role will be to shore up StabilityAI's position in the wider generativeAI landscape, where it faces stiff competition.OpenAI's rival video generation tool Sora is the most high-profile name in the space,with Reuters reportingHollywood executives have discussed with the firm how the film industry could use its tech.Meanwhile, Hunger Games and John Wick studio Lionsgatemade a deal last weekwith AI firm Runway to create tools based on its massive archive of film and TV.And in recent weeks the video generation landscape has been shaken by the sudden emergence of MiniMax,created by China-based HailuoAI.The tool became popular on social media this month thanks to its ability to quickly create high-quality video from just a few lines of text.In particular, a recent trend has seen people using the tool to make videos about chef Gordon Ramsay, with one such popular post seeing him skydiving while cooking spaghetti.Ramsay has not responded to a request for comment.And Cameron is joining the AI industry at a critical time for a different reason - copyright.The technology works by analysing human-made pictures, including images found online, and artists claim this means their work has been used without permission.Stability AI founder Emad Mostaquehas previously told BBC NewsStable Diffusion is trained using ""100,000 GB of images"" taken from the internet.Getty Images, which is working on its own AI image generator,is suing StabilityAIover this very thing."
Positive and negative consequences,"The study has been published by the European arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO).Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, the WHO's regional director for Europe, said the findings made clear social media could have both positive and negative consequences for young people.He said there needed to be more ""digital literacy education"" to help young people develop a healthy approach to being online, and governments, health authorities, teachers and parents all had to play their part.""It's clear we need immediate and sustained action to help adolescents turn the tide on potentially damaging social media use, which has been shown to lead to depression, bullying, anxiety, and poor academic performance,"" he said.Ben Carter, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, described the report as a “useful snapshot of the evidence"".But he pointed out it was difficult to agree on a definition of what “problematic social media” was, making gathering data on it challenging.Nonetheless, he said the study was a “valid contribution to the evidence base""."
The 'chaos' at the airports,"Melanie Cree and her husband Alan, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, were due to fly home from Corfu Airport on the day of the outage.Travel operators were forced to cancel thousands of flights across the world - and Melanie and Alan's flight was axed.After being taken to and from the airport several times in the next few days, they managed to fly home on Monday. Melanie said passengers were given no food, and some ran out of medication.""It totally ruined what should have been our dream holiday,"" she said.""We have lovely memories, but we came back absolutely shattered. It was complete chaos.""Their provider Tui gave them a £400 voucher. As Melanie and Alan struggled in Corfu, another UK family were caught up in the delays just over 500 miles (804km) away.Laura and Malcolm Jones were struggling to return home to Pontypool, in south Wales, after a holiday in Rhodes with their children.When they were on the tarmac, the flight was cancelled. Laura told the BBC there was no information, no return of bags, and no plan.They spent 16 hours at the airport before they were taken to a conference centre, where frustrated travellers used tablecloths as blankets.The family paid £560 out of their own pockets to fly back to the UK a few days later.Tui has given them a £600 voucher.""I was looking forward to travelling abroad again after Covid, but I think I might just stick going to west Wales for a few years,"" Laura joked.In a statement, Tui apologised to its customers. But the travel company was not the only one with problems. Delta Airlines in the United States faced a huge impact.It cancelled around 7,000 flights over five days,faces an investigation from the US authorities and is involved in several legal actions."
The small business owners,"Back in the UK, small business owner Dawn Watts from Market Drayton, Staffordshire was caught up in the outages in a different way - her website, which provides supplies to cleaning companies and hotels, was out of action.She estimates to have lost about £600 in sales.""It is extremely worrying,"" she said.""I am a sole trader - I can’t have this happening again."" Hannah Al-Khaldi, who runs a boutique fitness studio in London, faced similar issues with a non-functional website.She estimates the outage cost her £1,000.""It showed how many systems worldwide had put their eggs in one basket,"" she said.""When one link in the chain fails, everything else goes down.""Is there enough choice out there for providers, or was CrowdStrike the only option?"""
Early power,"By 1880, while some homes were lit by electricity, they were rare and, like J P Morgan's, required individual generators. In fact,gas was more commonly used for lighting in New York. ""Manufactured gas – essentially the gas produced by heating coal – was being piped to the wealthier parts of the city, lit and used for illumination,"" says Lifset. But the city was already eager for a better alternative to gas, says Harold Wallace, curator of the electricity collections at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington DC. ""Politicians are complaining about companies that aren't maintaining their systems well, users are complaining about odours and impure gases that are being used, and there's a lot of calls for something to replace, or at least provide competition for, the gas systems,"" he says. An enthusiastic group of engineers and inventors centred in New York were eyeing this opportunity. The sheer size and density of New York, already a very populous city, provided an incredibly handy backdrop for field tests on electricity networks. ""Being able to test at scale in New York City was really advantageous,"" says Wallace. ""[Edison and his team] figure if they can make the system work in New York, then they should be able to scale it down, basically, and make it work in other markets."" Another reason New York City was such an important early hub for the development of electric power systems was its stature as a finance centre, adds Wallace. ""[It was] a locus for investors and what we today would call venture capital."" First came experiments inarc lightingwhich could light up huge areas of streets with blinding light. Inventedin the early 1800s, arc lamps produce light by passing a high current across a gap between two conducting electrodes, usually carbon rods. New Yorkinstalled arc lights on towers in the 1860s; and in 1880 ahuge array of arc lightingwas installed two miles down Broadway, gaining it its moniker, ""The Great White Way"". Butthe dazzling arc lightwas too bright for use in homes, and for some, too bright to use anywhere. New York's real field test was still to come."
A softer light,"The inventor Thomas Edison had gained widespread fame with his inventions of animproved telegraphandtelephone, as well as thephonograph, the first device to play back recorded sound. In 1878, he saw arc lights for the first time and quickly became obsessed with the potential for rolling out electric lighting more widely, writes Bell. In 1879, heannouncedthat he had invented the first practical incandescent lightbulb – which avoided the intense brightness of arc lights – at his research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Dynamos, orself-excited generators, invented around 1870, now existed which could put out a ""tremendous amount of electric power"", sufficient to power arc lights and other high-power electrical systems, says Wallace. The components of domestic lighting were ready for use. Edison had opened a smallcoal-fired power station, the world's first to generate electricity for public use, in London in early 1882. But New Yorkwas his real focus. After his trial run at Morgan's house in June 1882, in September of the same year the Edison Illuminating Company opened its Pearl Street station in lower Manhattan, widely credited as being theworld's first commercial power station. It featured six coal-powered generators using several miles of cables laid under the street. These under-street cables gave an advantage over the hated muddle of overhead wires starting to criss-cross New York, although installing them did require the temporary inconvenience of closing off streets. The stationprovided electricity to homes at a price comparable to gas, and by 1883 had over 500 customers. ""Customers around Pearl Street were given the special introductory offer of a box of lightbulbs for free, and block by block, the lightly twinkling electric-lit cityscape we are now so familiar with emerged from the shadows,"" writes Bell. Edison was adamant that he was creating a lighting system, not a general overall electrical system, which evolved later, says Wallace. But he did want to make sure it was competitive with gas, he adds, coming up with a figure of a 16-candlepower output, so as to top the 15-candlepower he had surveyed as the average light produced by a gas jet in New York City."
Current wars,"Edison had plans to expand his system throughout Manhattan and New York City, says Wallace. As the Pearl Street station used purely direct current (DC), though, it could only power homes within around a quarter mile radius, he says. This is because the voltage of DCcould not be easily convertedat the time, making it hard to transmit DC at high voltages, thus meaning DC electricity would see large losses over long distances. A larger DC network would therefore require many small stations. ""Edison was going to put a series of these stations throughout Manhattan,"" says Wallace. While working for Edison, the charismatic Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla had proposed using a different electricity system based on alternating current (AC). ""With alternating current, you can transmit the power over much further distances,"" says Wallace. ""You can have a few much larger power stations."" AC could bemore easily convertedbetween high and low voltages using transformers, which only work on AC electricity. But Edison dismissed the proposal, arguinghis more establishedDC was safer than the experimental AC which had ""no future to it"". Tesla soon quit and teamed up with railway entrepreneur George Westinghouse, who was also interested in the ability of AC generators to transport electricity over long distances. Soon Westinghouse and Edison were head to head in the notoriouswar of the currents, with Edison attempting to discredit AC. The bitter feud included a series of patent suits, abooklet publicly issued by Edisonwarning about the dangers of AC, andpublic electrocutions of stray animals using ACin an attempt to demonstrate its danger. Edison alsoadvised the New York State Death Commissionthat AC was the best choice for human electrocution (the reality is thatit's complicatedto answer which is more unsafe). By 1891, though, there were almost1,000 AC central stations across the US, five times the number of Edison stations. A huge win for the AC proponents was its winning bid to provide electricity for the1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's Columbian Exposition. Westinghouseundercutthe bid from Edison's General Electric, a huge chance to publicise and demonstrate the competence of AC. AC's dominance was solidified that same year:after much wrangling, the Niagara Falls Power Company gave Westinghouse (usingTesla's all-important AC patents) the contract to generate power from a new hydro plant being built at Niagara Falls. This was to be theworld's first large-scale hydroelectric power plant. ""The two Niagara stations would generate a mind-boggling 100,000 horsepower, equal to all the central stations then operating in America,"" writes Jones. ""Never had electricity been generated on such a scale."" In 1895, a 26-mile (42km) AC line was energised from Niagara to Buffalo and began supplying electricityfor the city's bulbs, industry and streetcars. Buffalo would soon become the first American city to have widespread electric lighting,earning it the name the ""City of Light"". The war of the currents was hugely important in determining the future of electrical systems, according to Lifset. ""The switch to AC power allowed for the use of larger power plants located further away from their customers,"" he says. ""This served as the foundation for the industry's emerging business model. It's what allowed electricity to become cheap and was a significant factor in the spread of electrification."" Over the following decades, electrification swept through New York. Early adopters included commercial businesses looking to attract customers, the wealthy and the city itself, says Lifset. ""Industry was not far behind. It took longer for middle and working-class people to get access.""By 1899, though, anyone in Manhattan could connect to electricity. Electricity also spread out further afield, although not to everyone. ""Most urban landscapes in the US were electrified by the 1910s,"" says Lifset. ""[But] it took considerably longer for this process to play out in rural America."" Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla had proven that electricity was a game changer for lighting. But it wasn't the end for gas. ""The gas industry went back, they upgraded their systems, they came up with new refinements so they could put out cleaner gas that didn't have the smell or create quite as much soot,"" says Wallace. ""They also came up with new applications."" The industry began promoting gas for cooking, heating and evenrefrigerators. Electricity also soon expanded to more than lighting. ""Very quickly within the 1880s other applications occur,"" says Wallace, including electric fans and irons as well as larger items like refrigerators and stoves. ""[Electric refrigerators and stoves] take quite a bit more of an investment, so most people couldn't afford them early on, but they could afford an electric fan, or especially an electric iron was marketed very heavily early on."" Since most tenements or apartment homes had only a single light bulb socket hanging in the middle of the room, these early irons and fans would have light bulb bases that could be attached to an adapter and plugged into this socket, says Wallace. ""It was not until the late 1890s, into the early 1900s, when what they called convenience outlets, [what] we think of as wall sockets today, first really started coming on the market."""
A new transition,"Electricity has long reached dominance in the industrial world for lighting and most appliances. But when it comes toheatingandtransport, fossil fuels remain the principal player. What's more, while some electricity comes from renewables like hydropower, as it did in Buffalo in the late 19th Century, most comes from coal and gas generating stations. Even today, fossil fuels account for the majority of electricity generation inNew York State, inthe USandaround the world. So in the current era of climate crisis, New York, like the rest of the world, is facing another energy transition: the move from fossil fuel to renewable energy. A huge piece of the puzzle in how to do this is furtherelectrificationof our energy use – in particular, heat and transport. More like this: In May 2023, New Yorkbecame the first state in the USto ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings from 2026. By 2029, taller new buildings will have to do the same. That means electric devices, such as heat pumps, electric heaters and induction ovens, will need to be used for heating and cooking instead of gas-powered ones. The state alsoaims for all new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2035. New York's2019 Climate Acttargets an 85% cut in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels. To help achieve this, it mandates that 70% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2030 and that allelectricity should be zero-carbon – including nuclear – by 2040. Currently, renewables, largely from hydroelectric plants, providealmost 30% of the state's electricity generation. Buthalf of electricity still comes from natural gas. It's stillnot clear if New York will hit its 2030 renewables target, although Hochul has said she remains steadfast in her commitment to the goals. Speaking to delegates atthe energy and economy summit,she called on them to take the story of Edison, Tesla and their contemporaries at the beginnings of electricity as a source of inspiration for today's climate action. ""New York state has been an energy pioneer for 150 years…electricity was made here,"" she said. ""[Today], we are called to invest in an emissions-free energy economy… Let's engage, let's strategise and solve these [emissions] problems with the same can-do spirit."" *Jocelyn Timperley is a senior journalist for BBC Future.

Riddle me this,"Let's start with a question that's so easy to solve it doesn't qualify as a riddle by human standards. A2023 studyasked an AI to tackle a series of reasoning and logic challenges. Here's one example: Mable's heart rate at 9am was 75bpm and her blood pressure at 7pm was 120/80. She died at 11pm. Was she alive at noon? It's not a trick question. The answer is yes. But GPT-4 – OpenAI's most advanced model at the time – didn't find it so easy. ""Based on the information provided, it's impossible to definitively say whether Mable was alive at noon,"" the AI told the researcher. Sure, in theory, Mable could have died before lunch and come back to life in the afternoon, but that seems like a stretch. Score one for humanity. The Mable question calls for ""temporal reasoning"", logic that deals with the passage of time. An AI model might have no problem telling you that noon comes between 9am and 7pm, but understanding the implications of that fact is more complicated. ""In general, reasoning is really hard,"" Pitkow says. ""That's an area which goes beyond what AI currently does in many cases."" A bizarre truth about AI iswe have no idea how it works. We know on a high level – humans built AI, after all. Large language models (LLMs) use statistical analysis to find patterns in enormous bodies of text. When you ask a question, the AI works through the relationships it's spotted between words, phrases and ideas, and uses that to predict the most likely answer to your prompt. But the specific connections and calculations that tools like ChatGPT use to answer any individual question arebeyond our comprehension, at least for now. The same is true about the brain: we know very little about how our minds function. Themost advanced brain-scanning techniquescan show us individual groups of neurons firing as a person thinks. Yet no one can say exactly what those neurons are doing, or how thinking works for that matter. By studying AI and the mind in concert, however, scientists could make progress, Pitkow says. After all, the current generation of AI uses ""neural networks"" which aremodelled after the structure of the brainitself. There's no reason to assume AI uses the same process as your mind, but learning more about one reasoning system could help us understand the other. ""AI is burgeoning, and at the same time we have this emerging neurotechnology that's giving us unprecedented opportunities to look inside the brain,"" Pitkow says."
Trusting your gut,"The question of AI and riddles gets more interesting when you look at questions that are designed to throw off human beings. Here's a classic example: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Most people have the impulse to subtract 1.00 from 1.10, and say the ball costs $0.10, according to Shane Frederick, a professor of marketing at the Yale School of Management, who's studied riddles. And most people get it wrong. The ball costs $0.05. ""The problem is people casually endorse their intuition,"" Frederick says. ""People think that their intuitions are generally right, and in a lot of cases they generally are. You couldn't go through life if you needed to question every single one of your thoughts."" But when it comes to the bat and ball problem, and a lot of riddles like it, your intuition betrays you. According to Frederick, that may not be the case for AI. Human beings are likely to trust their intuition,unless there's some indication that their first thought might be wrong. ""I'd suspect that AI wouldn't have that issue though. It's pretty good at extracting the relevant elements from a problem and performing the appropriate operations,"" Frederick says. The bat and ball question is a bad riddle to test AI, however. It's famous, which means that AI models trained on billions of lines of text have probably seen it before. Frederick says he's challenged AI to take on more obscure versions of the bat and ball problem, and found the machines still do far better than human participants – though this wasn't a formal study."
Novel problems,"If you want AI to exhibit something that feels more like logical reasoning, however, you need a brand-new riddle that isn't in the training data. For a recent study (available inpreprint), Ilievski and his colleagues developed a computer program that generates original rebus problems, puzzles that use combinations of pictures, symbols and letters to represent words or phrases. For example, the word ""step"" written in tiny text next to a drawing of four men could mean ""one small step for man"". The researchers then pitted various AI models against these never-before-seen rebuses and challenged real people with the same puzzles. As expected, human beings did well, with an accuracy rate of 91.5% for rebuses that used images (as opposed to text). The best performing AI, OpenAI's GPT-4o got 84.9% right under optimal conditions. Not bad, butHomo sapiensstill have the edge. According to Ilievski, there's no accepted taxonomy that breaks down what all of the various different kinds of logic and reasoning are, whether you're dealing with a human thinker or a machine. That makes it difficult to pick apart how AI fares on different kinds of problems. One studydivided reasoning into some useful categories. The researcher asked GPT-4 a series of questions, riddles, and word problems that represented 21 different kinds of reasoning. These included simple arithmetic, counting, dealing with graphs, paradoxes, spatial reasoning and more. Here's one example, based on a 1966 logic puzzle called theWason selection task: Seven cards are placed on the table, each of which has a number on one side and a single-coloured patch on the other side. The faces of the cards show 50, 16, red, yellow, 23, green, 30. Which cards would you have to turn to test the truth of the proposition that if a card is showing a multiple of four then the colour of the opposite side is yellow? GPT-4 failed miserably. The AI said you'd need to turn over the 50, 16, yellow and 30 cards. Dead wrong. The proposition says that cards divisible by four have yellow on the other side – but it doesn't say thatonlycards divisible by four are yellow. Therefore, it doesn't matter what colour the 50 and 30 cards are, or what number is on the back of the yellow card. Plus, by the AI's logic, it should have checked the 23 card, too. The correct answer is you only need to flip 16, red, and green. It also struggled with some even easier questions: Suppose I'm in the middle of South Dakota and I'm looking straight down towards the centre of Texas. Is Boston to my left or to my right? This is a tough one if you don't know American geography, but apparently, GPT-4 was familiar with the states. The AI understood it was facing south, and it knew Boston is east of South Dakota, yet it still gave the wrong answer. GPT-4 didn't understand the difference between left and right. The AI flunked most of the other questions, too. The researcher's conclusion: ""GPT-4 can't reason."" For all its shortcomings, AI is getting better. In mid-September, OpenAI releaseda preview of GPT-o1, a new model built specifically for harder problems in science, coding and maths. I opened up GPT-o1 and asked it many of the same questions from the reasoning study. It nailed the Wason selection rask. The AI knew you needed to turn left to find Boston. And it had no problem saying, definitively, that our poor friend Mable who died at 11pm was still alive at noon. There are still a variety of questions where AI has us beat.One testasked a group of American students to estimate the number of murders last year in Michigan, and then asked a second group the same question about Detroit, specifically. ""The second group gives a much larger number,"" Frederick says. (For non-Americans, Detroit is in Michigan, but the city has an outsized reputation for violence.) ""It's a very hard cognitive task to look past the information that's not right in front of you, but in some sense that's how AI works,"" he says. AI pulls in information it learned elsewhere. More like this:•Can a computer teach you to apologise effectively?•AI took their jobs. Now they get paid to make it sound human•The chatbots that say they can feel emotions That's why the best systems may come from a combination of AI and human work; we can play to the machine's strengths, Ilievski says. But when we want to compare AI and the human mind, it's important to remember ""there is no conclusive research providing evidence that humans and machines approach puzzles in a similar vein"", he says. In other words, understanding AI may not give us any direct insight into the mind, or vice versa. Even if learning how to improve AI doesn't reveal answers about the hidden workings of our minds, though, it could give us a hint. ""We know the brain has different structures related to things like memory value, movement patterns and sensory perception, and people are trying to incorporate more and more structures into these AI systems,"" Pitkow says. ""This is why neuroscience plus AI is special, because it runs in both directions. Greater insight into the brain can lead to better AI. Greater insight into AI could lead to better understanding of the brain."" Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

Rising fame and philanthropy,"MrBeast is no stranger to controversy this year - and has managed to come out unscathed each time.In July, the 26-year-old American said he had hired investigators after his former co-host Ava Kris Tyson wasaccused of grooming a teenager.Ava denied the allegations, but has apologised for ""past behaviour"" which was ""not acceptable"".MrBeast said he was ""disgusted"" by the ""serious allegations"".Later, further allegations about business practices surfaced on an anonymous YouTube channel, claiming to be a former employee. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims or this person's identity.Some of his philanthropic efforts - such as building wells in Africa, and paying for surgery for people with reduced sight and hearing - have drawn criticisms around exploitation.""Deaf people like me deserve better than MrBeast’s latest piece of inspiration porn,""one person told the Independent last year.But his empire continues to grow. The day before the lawsuit emerged on Wednesday, he revealed a team-up with fellow famous faces KSI and Logan Paul - a new food line designed to challenge Lunchables.And as I wrotein an article about his meteoric rise last year, he has made his millions through hard work.His videos are big budget experiences, with his most popular - viewed 652 million times -recreating the Netflix hit Squid Game in real lifewith a $456,000 (£342,000) prize.Most of his philanthropy is less controversial - including giving away houses, cash and cars - which has worked to create an image of him being one of the internet's good guys.According to his website, he has delivered more than 25 million meals to the needy around the world.People continue to flock to his social channels. In June, he gained enough subscribers to make hisYouTube channel the largest in the world.According tostats-checker Socialblade, MrBeast picked up an extra five million subscribers in the last 30 days alone.That’s just one metric - we can’t tell how many people unsubscribed from his channel, for example.What is certain is that the number of people who’ve actively decided to stop watching his videos has been eclipsed by those who’ve decided to subscribe."
The YouTube apology,"He wouldn't be the only YouTuber whose popularity holds through controversy - others have faced far more significant storms than MrBeast, with few facing many consequences outside of a public apology.Logan Paul faced a massive backlash in 2018 after he uploaded a video to his 15 million subscribers which showed the body of a person who had apparently taken their own life.After removing the original video,he shared a less than two-minute apologytitled simply: ""So sorry.""Now, he has 23 million subscribers, owns an incredibly popular sports drink, and up until August was the WWE United States champion. He's had quite a few pay-per-view boxing bouts, too.Other high-profile YouTubers, including Pewdiepie, James Charles, and Jeffree Star have all had their own controversies, and got on with their careers after uploading apology videos.A more modern example is Herschel ""Guy"" Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, who admitted he sent messages to ""an individual minor"" in 2017.He stressed that ""nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed"" and went offline for two months after posting the statement.His comeback livestream earlier this month attracted more than three million views, despite criticism from other high-profile streamers.Dr Disrespect remains the second-most watched streamer in the US this year,according to Streams Charts.The point is: YouTubers tend to be forgiven quickly."
What next for MrBeast?,"While MrBeast's fanbase has continued growing, controversy is swirling once again - and his next move could determine his long-term success.James Lunn, chief strategy officer at Savvy Marketing, says the star is ""in an incredibly unique position"" with a ""multi-faceted"" brand spanning many industries.""We are indeed in uncharted waters,"" he says, and ""a proactive approach, addressing the issues transparently and ensuring accountability, could protect his brand"".Brand expert Catherine Shuttleworth says the ""sheer scale"" of MrBeast’s fame may act as a buffer against backlash, but the latest lawsuit could be difficult.""When it comes to his business ventures, particularly those targeting families and children - like Feastables chocolate bars or Lunchly - it’s a different story,"" she says.""Parents, who often hold the purchasing power, tend to be less tolerant of controversies involving safety, fairness, and ethics.""Back in August 2023, when writing about MrBeast, I predicted he would soon take the YouTube crown despite him having half as many subscribers then.He is now facing extra challenges as his fame rises, and a lot of the internet is eagerly awaiting his reply to what is, so far, one side of a complex story."
Pitching a free-market cryptocity,"At some point during the day-long pitching session in Amsterdam, a young man in a grey hoodie slouched on stage. His name was Dryden Brown. He said he wanted to build a new city-state, somewhere on the Mediterranean coast. It would be governed not by a giant state bureaucracy, but on the blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrency. Its founding principles would be ideas of “vitality” and “heroic virtue”. He called it Praxis, the Ancient Greek word for “action”. The first citizens of this new nation, he said, would be able to move in in 2026.He was a little hazy on the details. Move in where exactly? Who would build the infrastructure? Who would run it? Dryden Brown fumbled with a remote and pulled up a slide, suggesting Praxis was backed by funds with access to hundreds of billions of dollars of capital.For now, though, the “Praxis community” exists mainly on the internet. There is a website where you can apply for citizenship. Who, exactly, these citizens are, is unclear. Dryden flashed up another slide with his remote. It was a Pepe meme: the sad-looking cartoon frog that became an “alt-right” mascot during the Trump campaign in 2016.In this niche world of startup nations, Praxis had a reputation for edginess. They hosted legendary parties: people spoke of candle-lit soirees in giant Manhattan loft spaces, where awkward computer coders mixed with hipster models and figures from the “Dark Enlightenment” – people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advocates a totalitarian future in which the world is ruled by corporate “monarchs”. His ideas are sometimes described as fascist, something he denies. Attendees would be made to sign an NDA. Journalists were generally not welcome.After his presentation, I went to talk to Dryden Brown. He seemed suspicious and a little cold, but he gave me his phone number. I messaged him a few times, trying to engage him in conversation. To no avail.But then, about six months later, I spotted an intriguing notice on X. “Praxis magazine launch. Tomorrow night. Photocopy your favourite pages.” There was no time given, no location. Just a link where you could apply to attend. I applied. No answer. So, next morning, I texted Dryden Brown again. And to my surprise, he replied right away: “Ella Funt at 10pm.” Ella Funt turned out to be a bar and nightclub in Manhattan. Formerly known as Club 82, it had once been a legendary spot on the New York gay scene; in the 1950s, writers and artists would go there to drink cocktails served by women in tuxedos and watch drag acts in the basement. Now it was hosting an exclusive party for people who wanted to start a new country. And I had somehow got myself an invite. But I was 2000 miles away in Utah. If I was going to make it in time, I had to get on a flight right away.I was actually one of the first to arrive. The place was almost empty, with a few Praxis people laying out copies of their magazine around the bar. I flicked through it: expensive, heavy paper; lots of advertisements for seemingly random things: perfume; 3D-printed guns; one for just… milk. Like Pepe the Frog, milk is an internet meme. In “alt-right” circles, posting an icon of a white milk bottle signals white supremacy.The magazine urged readers to “photocopy pages and paste them around your town” – a kind of analogue memetics. A Xerox machine had been wheeled into the bar for that very purpose.A group of young men walked in, some wearing cowboy boots. They didn’t look like outdoor types though. I got talking to one of them. He introduced himself as Zac, a “crypto cowboy” from Milton Keynes (he was wearing a leather Stetson.)“I kind of represent the American Wild West,” he said. “I feel as though we are at the frontier.”Plenty of people associate cryptocurrencies with scams: highly volatile internet money, the value of which could disappear overnight. But in the world of the “network state”, they love crypto. They see it as the future of money – money that governments cannot control. The next person I got talking to called himself Azi. I asked for his surname. “Mandias,” he replied with a smile. It was a reference to a sonnet by Percy Bysse Shelley: Ozymandias, King of Kings. Anonymity is an important part of the crypto ethos. I got the feeling no one at this party was giving me their real names.Mr Mandias was from Bangladesh originally, but had grown up in Queens, New York. He was the founder of a tech startup. He believed that, just as the printing press had contributed to the collapse of the feudal order in Europe 500 years ago, today new tech – crypto, the blockchain, AI – would bring about the collapse of the democratic nation state.“Obviously, democracy is great,” he said. “But the best ruler is a moral dictator. Some people call [that] the philosopher king.”"
The rise of the corporate king?,"Azi said he was excited to be “on the precipice of what I think is the next renaissance”. But before this renaissance, he predicted a “Luddite movement” against new technology that would destroy millions of jobs and monopolise the global economy. The Luddites would fail, Azi said. Yet he predicted that the transition period to what he called the “next stage” of human societal evolution – the “network state” stage – would be violent and “Darwinistic”.Far from being perturbed by this prospect, Azi seemed excited at the thought that out of the smouldering ashes of democracy, new kings would emerge: corporate dictators ruling over their networked empires.I wandered over to the bar and got myself a drink. There I got talking to two young women who did not look like they were part of the crypto crowd. Ezra was the manager of another nightclub nearby, her friend Dylan was a student. It looked like they’d been invited to add a bit of glamour to what was – essentially – a party of crypto-bros and computer geeks. But they had some thoughts about the whole network state idea.“What happens if you don't have enough employees in the hospital or at the school for the kids?” Dylan asked. “It is unrealistic to start an entire city without any government.” To Ezra, the whole idea seemed dystopian. “We wanted to see what a ‘real’ cult meeting was like,” she said, I think in jest.Just then, Dryden Brown appeared, the co-founder of Praxis. When he went outside for a cigarette, I followed him. The Praxis Magazine was a way to showcase the new culture he was hoping to build, he told me. Praxis, he said, was about “the pursuit of the frontier” and of “heroic virtue”.I doubted Dryden would last very long in a covered wagon out on the prairie. He looked exhausted by it all. I wanted to ask him some pointed questions about the network state project: who would be the citizens of this brave new world? Who would govern it? What was with all the alt-right memes? And – Dylan’s question – who was going to staff the hospitals?But we kept getting interrupted by more guests arriving. Dryden Brown invited me to visit the “Praxis Embassy” the following day. We said our see-you-tomorrows and went inside. The party was getting wilder. Ezra and Dylan and some friends who looked like models were climbing up on top of the Xerox machine. They were busy photocopying – not pages from the magazine, but bits of their bodies. I grabbed a copy of the magazine and left.Back at my tiny Airbnb above a Chinese supermarket, I leafed through it. Alongside the white supremacist memes and ads for guns, there was a QR code. It linked to a short film: a 20-minute polemic against the emptiness of modern life, a lament for a vanished world of hierarchies and heroism."
Between the lines,"“You are entertained and satiated,” the narrator intones, “you are seemingly productive. But you are not great.” The voice talks about the “algorithms making you hate yourself and your own civilisation”.At this point in the film, the screen shows an animated figure pointing a pistol straight at the viewer.“Contemporary media proclaims that having any ideals is fascist,” the voice continues. “Everything of conviction is fascist.”Was it an invitation to embrace the label of fascism? This movement seemed to yearn for a specific conception of Western culture - a Nietzschean world in which the fittest survive, where disruption and chaos give birth to greatness.The next day, I stopped by the “Praxis Embassy” – a giant loft space on Broadway. The bookshelves were indeed filled with copies of Nietzsche, biographies of Napoleon and a volume entitled The Dictator’s Handbook. I hung around for a bit, but Dryden Brown never turned up.I left wondering what exactly it was I had witnessed the previous night: was it a glimpse of the future, in which countries like the United States and the UK would collapse into a spider’s web of corporate societies, a world in which you could choose to become a citizen of a cyber statelet? Or were Dryden Brown and his friends just “trolling”, a bunch of tech bros roleplaying as alt-right revolutionaries in order to have a laugh at the expense of the establishment, and enjoy a good party?Might Dryden Brown one day become a CEO-king, ruler of an alt-right franchised empire with outposts dotted around the Mediterranean? I doubt it. But there are moves to promote more autonomous zones, free ports and charter cities. And if democracy is in trouble, the network state movement looks like it is waiting in the wings.Top image credit: Getty BBC InDepthis the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Restrictive clauses,"This case revolved around Google's AdSense product, which delivers adverts to websites - making Google almost like a broker for ads.The Commission concluded Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than AdSense when they were seeking adverts for their web pages.It said the firm then added other ""restrictive"" clauses to its contracts to reinforce its market dominance - and levied a €1.49bn fine as a penalty.In its ruling, the EU's General Court upheld the majority of the Commission’s findings - but annulled the decision by which the Commission imposed the fineIt said the Commission had not considered ""all the relevant circumstances"" concerning the contract clauses and how it defined the market.Because of this, it ruled the Commission did not establish ""an abuse of dominant position."""
Mixed messages,"Many studies that do find a link with poor mental health outcomes focus on ""problematic social media use"", where individuals have a lack of regulation over their use of social media. This has been associated withincreased prevalence of various forms of anxiety, for example, but alsodepression and stress. Some studies suggest there is adose-related aspect at work, where negative mental health symptoms increase with time spent on social media. But other studies suggestsuch associations are weakor have evenfound no evidencethat pins the spread of social media to widespread psychological problems. There are some studies that even suggest social media use in moderation can be beneficial in some circumstances by helping to create a sense of community. Indeed, theUS Surgeon General's own advisoryon the impact of tech on young people suggests that it has as many positive benefits as negatives. According to the Surgeon General's report, 58% of young people said social media helped them feel more accepted, and 80% praised its ability to connect people with their friends' lives. And there is even debate about whether problematic social media use is a growing problem at all. Onerecent meta-analysis of 139 studies from 32 countriesconcluded that there was no sign it had increased over the past seven years, apart from in low income countries where theprevalence of mental health conditions tends to be higher. One problem that crops up regularly is that many of the studies in this area rely upon self-reported mood and usage patterns, which can lead to bias in the data, but also use such a wide variety of methods that they are not easily compared. But this uncertainty in the science hasn't stopped the drumbeat of concern among child-protection campaigners and legislators. They argue thata precautionary principle is prudentand that more needs to be done to force big tech platforms to take action, with the two new pieces of legislation introduced by Hochul being just the latest move. ""There's a real sense of urgency about it all, that we must seen to be doing something right now this minute to fix the problem,"" says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, and the author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time. ""But just because it feels like an urgent problem to fix doesn't mean that the first solution that comes along would actually work."""
Mixed responses,"Some experts in online safety have welcomed the new laws in New York. ""While New York's legislation is much broader and less targeted on concrete harms than theUK's Online Safety Act, it's clear that regulation is the only way that big tech will clean up its algorithms and stop children being recommended huge amounts of harmful suicide and self-harm content,"" says Andy Burrows, an advisor at the Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the parents of Molly Russell, a UK teenager who killed herself in 2017 after seeing a series of self-harm images on social media – a contributing factor to her death, according toa landmark rulingin 2022 by a London coroner. Burrows says Hochul's swift actions should be seen favourably compared to the US Congress, which he claims ""drags its feet on passing comprehensive federal measures"". ""The bar is quite low and this legislation only stands out as better compared to the numerous pieces of bad legislation out there,"" says Jess Maddox, assistant professor in digital media at the University of Alabama. ""In terms of states in the US trying to regulate social media, this is some of the better attempts I've seen."" She praises it for not preventing minors from using social media outright, as asimilar plan in Floridais attempting – a measure some worry will cause digital literacy issues and leave children less prepared for the future. ""This does put the onus on social media platforms to do something,"" says Maddox. The response from social media platforms themselves has been mixed. Netchoice, an industry body that represents many of the major technology companies including Google, X, Meta and Snap, described the New York legislation as""unconstitutional"" and heavy handed. It warned the laws could even have unintended consequences such as potentially increasing the risk of children being exposed to harmful content by removing the ability to curate feeds and presenting possible privacy issues. But a spokesperson for Meta, which runs Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said: ""While we don't agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognising the responsibility of app stores."" They pointed toresearchsuggesting the majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval, and added: ""We will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach."" X, TikTok, Apple and Google, YouTube's parent company, did not respond to the BBC's request to comment for this story. Laws mandating parental consent on social media have also faced legal hurdles. In February,a federal judge upheld a block on an Ohio lawthat required parents' permission before kids under 16 use social media. When the SAFE Act faces inevitable scrutiny, the debate around the science could further dampen it's viability, says Ysabel Gerrard, senior lecturer in digital communication at the University of Sheffield in the UK, who has been studying the online safety movement. ""It takes as its premise that social media 'addiction' is a proven phenomenon, but it isn't,"" she says. ""While there's consensus that platforms are, by their very design, and as profit-seeking endeavours, aimed to be enjoyable for their users and to retain their attention, whether that should be classed as 'addiction' is still under debate."" But Gerrard says the second piece of legislation, the New York Child Data Protection Act is stronger. ""I've long worried about the loss of control children – well, all of us – have over their data and the lack of knowledge we all have about where it goes,"" she says. She believes the law will require platforms to explain where they're using the data they're collecting, which would be a sea change. ""While I entirely agree with the principles behind this Act, I will be interested to see how it evolves, as it would require platforms to do something they haven't yet managed, and to society's detriment."" Sam Spokony, a representative for Governor Hochul, declined to comment when contacted for a response to the criticism."
Enforcement troubles,"There are those who also fear that the wrong approach to regulating social media platforms could ultimately have longer-term consequences. While Maddox praises the acts for being better than some other state-level attempts, ""this is where my praise ends as it seems largely unenforceable"", she says. She points out that it's difficult to end ""addictive feeds"" in a single state, and compares it to online age verification laws that have effectively banned access to pornographic websites on a state-by-state basis in the US. One concern is that verifying that social media feeds have been made less addictive once the law goes into effect is going to be difficult. That in itself will make it hard to enforce. ""In being unenforceable, I could see social media companies pointing to this as evidence they can't or shouldn't be regulated,"" says Maddox. Another challenge is the many different approaches being taken by different states to regulate children's use of social media. Social media networks often transcend not just state boundaries but also international borders.Many key policy makers are sympatheticto the difficulty of implementing differing local restrictions. And already, this mixture of local laws has given social media companies room to challenge the legislation through the courts in places includingOhio,California,Arkansas. Maddox fears that if such laws are rushed into place, it can do more harm than good in attempts to protect children online than legislation that has had time to be properly scrutinised. More like this: •The one simple change that will improve your media diet in 2024•US surgeon general wants social media warning labels•Adults and teens turn to 'dumbphones' to cut screen time ""For the short term, we may have done something, but in the long term, nothing will likely happen,"" she says. She's not alone in that fear. ""I worry that folks in power are wasting precious time on something that is unenforceable,"" says Gerrard. So do critics of the new legislation see a better alternative? ""Clearly in the long run it will be much better for all involved – and I think that also includes the tech companies – to have a single, well developed federal approach rather than a patchwork of 50 states taking separate approaches,"" says Burrows. A unified, single approach that is based on evidence, and acts as a global standard would be preferable, say the experts, and the technology industry tends to agree. The nascent world of AI regulation offers models that could be adopted to social media as well. For example, lawmakers are fighting to mandate public algorithm audits to make companies open their AI systems to outside experts. However, it is an approach that still may require a global consensus: the UK, for instance, asks AI model makers to submit their products for analysis by its AI oversight body, but a number of firms have said they wouldn't do so because the jurisdiction is comparatively small. In the meantime, individual states are pushing ahead with their attempts to protect children from what they might see and feel while using social media, while big tech also is pushing back. It seems clear that the war over the future of social media is only just getting started. -- For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to theTech Decoded newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

How will it work?,"Teen accounts will mostly change the way Instagram works for users between the ages of 13 and 15, with a number of settings turned on by default.These include strict controls on sensitive content to prevent recommendations of potentially harmful material, and muted notifications overnight.Accounts will also be set to private rather than public - meaning teenagers will have to actively accept new followers and their content cannot be viewed by people who don't follow them. Parents who choose to supervise their child's account will be able to see who they message and the topics they have said they are interested in - though they will not be able to view the content of messages.However, media regulator Ofcom raised concerns in Aprilover parents' willingness to intervene to keep their children safe online.In a talk last week, senior Meta executive Sir Nick Clegg said: “One of the things we do find… is that even when we build these controls, parents don’t use them.”"
Age identification,"The system will primarily rely on users being honest about their ages, but Instagramalready uses tools to verify a user's ageif they are suspected to be lying about their age.From January, in the US, it will use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to proactively detect teens using adult accounts, to put them back into a teen account.The UK's Online Safety Act, passed earlier this year, requires online platforms to take action to keep children safe, or face huge fines.Ofcom warned social media sites in Maythey could be named, shamed or banned for under-18sif they fail to comply with its new rules.Social media industry analyst Matt Navarra said Instagram's changes were significant, but hinged on enforcement.""As we've seen with teens throughout history, in these sorts of scenarios, they will find a way around the blocks, if they can,"" he told the BBC."
Questions for Meta,"Instagram is not the first platform to introduce such tools for parents - and already claims to have more than 50 tools aimed at keeping teens safe.In 2022 it introduced a family centre and supervision tools for parents, letting them see accounts their child follows and who follows them, among other features.Snapchat also introduced its own family centre allowing parents over the age of 25 see who their child is messaging and limit their ability to view certain content.YouTube said in September itwould limit recommendations of certain health and fitness videos to teenagers, such as those which ""idealise"" certain body types.Instagram's new measures raises the question of why, despite the large number of protections on the platform, young people are still exposed to harmful content.An Ofcom studyearlier this yearfound that every single child it spoke to had seen violent material online, with Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat being the most frequently named services they found it on.Under theOnline Safety Act, platforms will have to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or content that promotes suicide or self-harm.But the rules are not expected to fully take effect until 2025.What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recently announced plans to ban social media for children by bringing in a new age limit for kids to use platforms.Instagram’s latest tools put more control in the hands of parents, who will now take even more direct responsibility for deciding whether to allow their child greater freedom on Instagram, and supervising their activity and interactions.They will also need to have their own Instagram account.But parents cannot control the algorithms which push content towards their children, or what is shared by its billions of users around the world.Social media expert Paolo Pescatore said it was an ""important step in safeguarding children’s access to the world of social media and fake news.""""The smartphone has opened up to a world of disinformation, inappropriate content fuelling a change in behaviour among children,"" he said.""More needs to be done to improve children’s digital wellbeing and it starts by giving control back to parents."""
Constitutional right,"Jeffrey Fisher, representing creators concerned by the law, said it could impede their constitutional right to work with the editor and publisher of their choice – such as TikTok under its current ownership.TikTok creator Tiffany Cianci, who is not among the creators involved in the lawsuit, was livestreaming outside the hearing to update viewers on proceedings.She told the BBC that 65,000 people tuned into her TikTok Live.""The American people care about this issue,"" she said. ""They're tuning in because they're worried about losing something."" Ms Cianci added that the platform's use by politicians in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election felt ""hypocritical"" and made her doubt the security concerns at the heart of the controversial law.""If it were dangerous, they wouldn't be there,"" she said.Department of Justice lawyer Daniel Tenny argued against TikTok's defence that the code behind its platform is based in the United States.""There’s really no dispute here that the recommendation engine is maintained, developed, and written by ByteDance rather than TikTok US,"" he said.""It is not expression by Americans in America - it is expression by Chinese engineers in China.""Mr Fisher had claimed posts on the platform in the US were American speech that was ""at most curated by a foreign company"".In addition to data concerns, officials and lawmakers have expressed alarm at the prospect of TikTok being used by the Chinese government tospread propagandato Americans.However, advocates of America's powerful free speech rights, enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, have said upholding the divest-or-ban law would be a gift to authoritarian regimes everywhere.Xiangnong Wang, a staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said repressive regimes worldwide may use it to ""justify new restrictions on their own citizens’ right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad."""
'High stakes',"But according to James Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the law was drafted to withstand judicial scrutiny.""The substance of the case against TikTok is very strong,"" Mr Lewis said.""The key point is whether the court accepts that requiring divestiture does not regulate speech.""Mr Lewis added that the courts usually defer to the president on national security matters.Regardless of how the appeals court rules, most experts agree the case could drag on for months, if not longer.Gautam Hans, clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School, told the BBC he believes an appeal is likely either way.The government's ability to legislate and regulate where national security is concerned is ""paramount,"" he said.""They cannot have that limited by the courts.""But the issues are also ""existential"" for TikTok, he added, with the company saying it cannot divest and would as such have no choice but to shut down.Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at analysis firm Forrester, added the ""high stakes"" case would likely progress to the US' highest court, the Supreme Court.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon"
Who wants to ban TikTok in the US and why?,"Lawmakers from both major US political parties supported a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell to a non-Chinese company.They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users.TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government.In April, following approval by Congress, President Joe Biden signed a billpaving the way for TikTok's forced sale.Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed.Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020.But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook.Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Mr Trump as the Democrat candidate, has used TikTok and popular social media trends likeCharli XCX's ""brat"" to try and win over young voters.A spokesperson for her campaign haspreviously saidthey would ""just like to see a change in ownership"" of TikTok rather than its ban. Is TikTok really a danger to the West?Can TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?"
When could TikTok be banned?,"Mr Biden signing the bill into law did not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok, but it did start a ticking clock.The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect.TikTok said this could mean it is either forced to sell or shut down in the US by 19 January 2025, after the US presidential election in November.But the company's fight against the legislation in court, which beganwhen it sued to block the law in May, could take years."
How would a TikTok ban work?,"The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok.It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs.The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US.It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea."
What has TikTok said it will do about the ban?,"Arguments in TikTok's appeal begin in a Washington DC court on Monday 16 September and will be heard by a three-judge panel.A group of TikTok creators who oppose the law over concerns about its impact on their workwill also make their case at the hearing.TikTok has previously called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech.""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told usersin a video, ""we aren't going anywhere"".He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move."
How have TikTok users in the US responded?,"Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban.Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill.Butthe deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired.Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?US TikTok ban would be 'devastating', UK firms warn"
Is TikTok banned in other countries?,"It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere.TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020.It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission.The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phonesbecause of security fears."
How does TikTok work and how much user data does it collect?,"At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material.Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system.This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing.But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users."
Saving our history,"A quarter of all web pages that existed at some point between 2013 and 2023 now… don't. That's according to arecent studyby Pew Research Center, a think tank based in Washington, DC, which raised the alarm of our disappearing digital history. Researchers found the problem is more acute the older a web page is: 38% of web pages that Pew tried to access that existed in 2013 no longer function. But it's also an issue for more recent publications. Some 8% of web pages published at some point 2023 were gone by October that same year. This isn't just a concern for history buffs and internet obsessives. According to the study, one in five government websites contains at least one broken link. Pew found more than half of Wikipedia articles have a broken link in their references section, meaning the evidence backing up the online encyclopaedia's information is slowly disintegrating. But thanks to the work of the Internet Archive, not all those dead links are totally inaccessible. For decades, the Archive's Wayback Machine project has sent armies of robots to crawl through the cascading labyrinths of the internet. These systems download functional copies of websites as they change over time – often capturing the same pages multiple times in a single day – and make them available to public free of charge. ""When we then went and looked at how many of those URLs were available in the Wayback Machine, we found that two-thirds of those were available in a way,"" he says. In that sense, the Internet Archive is doing what it set out to do – it's saving records of online society for posterity. A few other organisations, big and small, work on similar projects. The US Library of Congress, for example, preservesgovernment websites,thesites of congressmembersand acollection of US news sites. The Library of Congress also preserved a copy ofevery single tweetsent since the founding of Twitter (now known as X), until the project was shut down in 2017. Other governments run their own initiatives. TheUK Web Archiveconducts an annual crawl of websites with .UK domain names, capturing a snapshot of the British internet at least once a year. In 2022, band of volunteers to set out tosave the Ukrainian internetas it was hit by Russian cyberattacks. But the scope of these projects is narrow, while the Internet Archive aims for a comprehensive approach. Given the available resources, it would be impossible to collect anything close to the whole internet, but its systems cast a broad net. Depending on what you're looking for, the Internet Archive's collection is so thorough it can sometimes feel like a functionally complete record of the web."
Success breeds complacency,"The Archive's publicly accessible documents help sustain records of our lives in the current era. It's become a standard practise on Wikipedia to cite copies of websites from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, rather than the original websites themselves. The organisation also preserves a vast collection of media that predates the digital era. The beloved 1977 comedy seriesFernwood 2 Nightisn't available on any streaming service, but you can watch it free on the Internet Archive. Books, magazines and websitescite the Internet Archive’s scanned digital copies of booksthat are unavailable in physical libraries. It even acts as a preservation tool for the public; anyone can upload videos, websites and practically anything else to organisation's servers. Among the major collections that the Wayback Machine has salvaged from the digital scrapheap aredeep records of websites built on GeoCities, a now defunct personal web hosting service. Long before social media, GeoCities was among the first platforms that made it easy for anyone to create their own website.Historiansview GeoCities asone of the most important chaptersin the early days of the world wide web, without the efforts of the Internet Archive, most of its websites would be lost. In more recent history, a US Congressional Committeerelied on the Internet Archiveto preserve article and documents related to the January 6 insurrection. ""Every few years there's a new platform come along and then the economic forces suddenly kind of collapse in it,"" says Andrew Jackson, preservation registry technical architect at the Digital Preservation Coalition, a UK-based advocacy group and charity that advises on how to preserve the world's online digital archives. ""That's one big source of churn."" The tech news website CNET faced backlash in 2023 after reports thatthe company had deleted tens of thousands of articles, amounting to decades of lost history. Among CNET's responses was a promise that all its deleted articles had been preserved in the Wayback Machine. Many critics argued the company was taking the Internet Archive for granted, passing on its own archival responsibilities. ""Even though Google and other search engines actively incentivise you to maintain stable URLs, it's just technically quite difficult to do that,"" says Jackson. ""Every time a new company kind of revamped its website, it has to work out how much of its new URLs it's going to try and maintain through time."" But it's worth remembering what the Internet Archive is: a non-profit organisation, financed by donations from charitable foundations. It makes for a never-ending project with exponentially growing costs. The Internet Archive volunteered to take on the mantle of being the world's leading library for our digital lives. As the web approaches its fourth decade, this entirely unofficial project has become a foundational pillar of the internet. But as our reliance on the Internet Archive grows, so too do the threats pecking away at its efforts."
Single points of failure,"Last week, the organisation announced amajor partnership with Google, where the tech giant engine will include links to the Wayback Machine in search results – though neither released financial details about the deal. But other recent news demonstrates that the project is still fragile. That vulnerability was laid bare in acourt caseagainst the Internet Archive by four large book publishers, who alleged that the Internet Archive’s practise of scanning physical books and lending out digital copies breaches US copyright law. Before the pandemic, the Internet Archive would only lend one digital copy at a time for each physical book in its collection. But during the Covid shutdowns, the organisation lifted that restriction,letting patrons borrow unlimited digital copies of booksto try and make up for the closure of physical libraries. A US courtruled that practice was illegalin 2023, and in early September, the Internet Archive’s appeal against that decision was rejected. The organisationpreviously saidthat it agreed to pay the a publishing industry trade group an undisclosed sum in relation to the case. With that lawsuit in the rearview, the Internet Archive is fighting yet anothercourt case against music labelsfor digitising records that could cost it $400m (about £305m) if it loses. It's an amount that could jeopardise the non-profit's survival. Internet Archive's director of library services Chris Freeland said the organisation is reviewing the courts' opiniona statementabout the ruling. Existential legal battles aren't the only hazards menacing the world of digital preservation. The British Library's UK Web Archive got a taste of some malevolent technical challenges last whena cyberattacktook its digital systems offline in October 2023. Almost a year later, the UK Web Archive is still dealing with the fallout. Online access to much of its collection is still unavailable. In May 2024,the Internet Archive announcedit was in the midst of a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, vandals or other bad actors set up automated systems to bombard websites with visits, attempting to push them offline by overwhelming their servers. At its peak, tens of thousands of concurrent visits were happening every second. Services, including the Wayback Machine, went down. It meant that the regular drumbeat of archiving was disrupted for a time, and there may be permanent gaps in the historical record as a result. The Internet Archive ""was started byone individual, and it has become a kind of linchpin"", says Jackson. ""It also feels like this potential single point of failure. Although it's a lot more sophisticated than just volunteers, it is one institution in one region, under one legal framework."" The organisation shares these concerns. If the Internet Archive's work stopped and ""that void wasn't immediately filled, then much of what is currently made available on the public web would be at risk"", says Graham. He's clear that the Internet Archive won't step back from its responsibilities anytime soon, but the project can use outside help. ""There are opportunities for many others to contribute in a variety of ways,"" he says."
"Shared responsibilities, split priorities","With no formal effort to organise efforts to preserve the internet, the project is left to hobbyists, volunteers, and a few groups of unofficial bodies that generally operate independently. ""It makes sense that the archival response is decentralised,"" says Mar Hicks, a historian of technology at the University of Virginia. ""But one of the problems is the varied priorities."" Hicks points out that one of the first things any archivist will consider when building an archive is what to prioritise. ""And when it's so decentralised, the priorities are going to be very different,"" Hicks says. ""There's going to be people in groups who prioritise trying to grab everything – as much as they possibly can, they might be very completionist."" Then there will be others who are focused only on certain areas – for instance, the UK archiving effort. The concern about such an ad hoc, decentralised approach is that it's possible there's overlap, meaning precious archiving resources are wasted getting duplicate or triplicate copies of the most popular websites – all while some areas that may have historical importance are overlooked because they fall between different groups' responsibilities. ""Archivists will tell you that these issues have existed for a very long time,"" Hicks says. But they're exacerbated by the level of stuff being produced in our digital world.Nearly a billion emailsare sent every day. YouTube reports thatmore than 500 hours'worth of video content is posted on the platform every minute. The internet is ""essentially a firehose of information and material,"" says Hicks. ""It doesn't make sense to try to catch everything that comes out of the firehose. That wouldn't make sense from a resource standpoint."" In one sense this is an old concern. ""We have, as historians, those same problems,"" says Hicks. ""We have a wealth of documents from the past. But we only have certain documents and certain people's voices, and a lot of those voices that were missing were incredibly important, and they've been erased."" For Hicks, there needs to be some sort of priority about what is being saved from the digital footprints of our generation. Otherwise we run the risk that rapidly ballooning costs will sideline efforts to save the history of the web – not to mention the oceans of digital files that live offline. ""If you have to keep everything, it becomes very expensive,"" says Jackson of the Digital Preservation Coalition. ""There's often older content or less compelling content [that] gets lost by the wayside,"" he says. ""We're not capturing the non-Western world well,"" admits Jackson. ""There are gaps now around incompleteness in different cultural domains."" And while many of those organisations work to fight against their biases and prejudices, they're often left to carry the weight of the task while governments and the companies that run the platforms and websites sit by. ""Independent groups of people, who are just caring about it and are willing to spend their free time doing it, are better resourced and more highly skilled than the institutions which are formally responsible,"" says Jackson. More like this:•Why there’s so little left of the early internet•How will future archaeologists study us?•Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same There's a vacuum, argues Hicks, which few people other than a handful of archivist obsessives are filling. ""It's not clear whose responsibility it is to archive [the internet] or whose interest it would serve,"" Hicks says. One thing is clear, though, Hicks says, we should all pay up to support the fight for preservation. ""From a very pragmatic perspective, if you do not pay these people and make sure that these archives are funded, they will not exist into the future, they will break down and then the whole point of collecting them will have gone out the window,"" says Hicks. ""Because the whole point of the archive is not that it just gets collected, but that it persists indefinitely into the future."" The Enlightenment of the 18th century saw the birth ofan international library movementas governments and philanthropists took on the need to preserve and distribute books for the public. But that sense of civic responsibility hasn't extended to the internet. That may be due to the complicated business interests of the digital world, or just the immense technical challenge. Or, perhaps, it's because it doesn't feel like the web needs saving to casual observers. A book is a more obviously finite resource; it can be lost or damaged. But the internet feels so accessible. Anyone with an internet connection can pull up a web browser and dial in a URL.

Breaking 1bn,"Part of the reason the footballer crossed the 1bn boundary first comes down to his decision to join YouTube last month, where his channel rocketed to 50 million subscribers within a single week.Compare that to Messi, whose channel has just 3.5m subscribers, despite having uploaded videos since 2011.The reason for the difference comes down to the rule that governs YouTube: content is king.Messi's channel has only uploaded one video in the past three years,a flashy ad for a football experiencebased around him that lasts half a minute.His other videos are similarly short - while the longer ones are usually montages or feature him speaking in his native Spanish.Ronaldo, Mbappé and a record-breaking commentSo far, Ronaldo's channel consists mainly of conversations between him and his wife Georgina Rodríguez, as well as his former Manchester United colleague Rio Ferdinand.But all this content has been tailored for an English-speaking audience - and even when Ronaldo is talking in Spanish or Portuguese,the videos are often dubbed into English.That, coupled with near-daily uploads and bright and colourful YouTube thumbnails. show Ronaldo (or more likely his social media team) know exactly how to make a video popular on the platform.He announced the news in a post shared across his various social media platforms. Cristiano Ronaldo has made a career out of breaking records.His successes include being top scorer in Uefa Champions League history, having the most goals in the European Championship, and making more international appearances than anyone else.Last week he became the first footballer to score 900 top-level career goals.As with his playing career, he still has scope to improve his numbers on social media too, as unlike some of his rivals, he is not on TikTok or Threads.All of which is likely to add to another figure he dominates: earnings.According to Forbes, his total earnings now stand at $260 million- the highest of any athlete."
Biggest mobile network,"Vodafone and Three revealed plans to merge their UK-based operations in June last year, creating the biggest mobile network in the UK with around 27 million customers.But the CMA provisionally concluded on Wednesday that such a deal would lead to a ""substantial lessening in competition"".In addition to worries over price and service levels, the regulator is also concerned that the deal may make it more difficult for smaller players such as Lyca Mobile, Sky Mobile and Lebara - who rent space from the bigger operators - to get a good deal.Vodafone and Three have said the tie-up would lead to an additional investment of £11bn in the UK.The CMA found that a merger of the two could improve the quality of mobile networks and accelerate next generation 5G networks and services, as claimed by the companies.But it considered these claims were ""overstated"", and that the merged firm would not necessarily have the incentive to carry out planned investment after the merger.In a statement, Vodafone and Three said they disagreed with the CMA's findings.""By all measures, the merger is pro-growth, pro-customer and pro-competition. It can, and should, be approved by the CMA,"" they said.The CMA will issue a final report into the deal in December.The firms added they would be working with the regulator to secure approval for the tie-up."
Pro consoles,"Companies have released updated versions of their own consoles with minor revisions for decades, but this release indicates the comparatively new trend of ""pro"" hardware is here to stay.Generally, this means hardware changes to current-generation consoles that lets games look better - but critically these tweaked consoles don't have exclusive games.In other words, games will still be released for PS5, and gamers can choose whether to play them on a regular console or a pro model with differences in graphics and performance.Paul Tamburro, from news website PlayStation LifeStyle, said fans had been hoping the console could ""bridge the gap"" between performance and fidelity modes, and the upgrade would help.""However, it also feels that the console doesn't do enough to justify that steep price point,"" he said.""It launching without a disc drive and still only targeting 60 FPS is disappointing.""This isn't an easy sell to current PS5 owners.""It's Sony's second major foray into this space after 2016's PS4 Pro, which brought 4k graphics to the original PlayStation 4.And it comes three years after Nintendo released its own take on a pro model - a Nintendo Switch with a larger, better screen."
Graphics leap,"Today's announcement from Sony is not as significant as the PS4's jump to 4k graphics, but it still represents a step forward in home consoles.It comes at a time when PCs have been getting increasingly powerful, with the release of Nvidia's Geforce 40 series of graphics cards in 2022, which have put PCs firmly ahead of home consoles in the race for the best visuals.But it's worth remembering just one of these graphics cards can cost as much as a whole PS5, so consoles tend to strike a balance between the best visuals and the best price.Like with the last console generation, this release means Sony will now have multiple versions of its PS5 available to consumers, with different price points and specs.Rumours spread widely ahead of the announcement, with fans speculating on the features an upgraded console might have.Chief among them were unsourced claims that the PS5 Pro would be backwards compatible with games from previous Sony consoles - with some reports suggesting this would go as far back as the original PlayStation.There was nothing in the announcement to confirm the rumours."
Rivals squeezed,"The EU's case against Google started with Foundem, which filed its complaint against the tech giant in 2009.At its heart was the contention that Google made its own shopping recommendations appear more prominent than rivals in search results.Google had tried to argue that the case had no legal or economic merit.But seven years ago, the Commission agreed that the tech giant effectively monopolised online price comparison by preventing others from getting a foothold in the market.That decision has now been upheld.Industry insiders have been keeping a close eye on the EU case, with suggestions that its outcome may illuminate the direction of travel of the many other antitrust cases Google is currently facing from the European Commission.The search giant has amassed fines of €8.2bn from the Commission, which has repeatedly alleged it abused its dominant market position. These are:2017: €2.4bn fine over shopping results2018: €4.3bn fine over claims it used Android software to unfairly promote its own apps2019: €1.5bn fine for blocking adverts from rival search enginesThe EU is also currently investigating the firm over whether it preferences its own goods and services over others in search results, as part of its Digital Markets Act.If it finds Google guilty, the firm could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual turnover.It is far from the only clash between the EU and big tech.In a separate judgement today, the ECJ hastold Apple it must pay back €13bn (£11bn; $14bn) in unpaid taxesto Ireland."
Anticompetition claims,"According to the lawsuitfiled by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and a coalition of statesin 2023, Google dominates the digital ad marketplace and has leveraged its market power to stifle innovation and competition.Google meanwhile contends it is just one of several hundred companies that facilitate the placement of digital ads in front of consumers.It argues that competition in the digital ad space is growing, not contracting - citing increased ad growth and revenues for companies such as Apple, Amazon and TikTok as proof in a blog postresponding to the DoJ's lawsuitin 2023. Both sides will present their cases to US District Judge Leonie Brinkema, who is expected to deliver a verdict.The bench trial comes on the heels of a landmark decision last month in a different monopoly case brought by the Justice Department against Google.Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google acted illegally to squelch competition in its online search business.“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” he wrote."
Make up or break up,"During last year's trial, Google said it dominated online search because it had a better product.And the company is seemingly deploying a similar defence in the ad tech case.When asked for a statement, it referred the BBC to its 2023 blog post, in which it states that “no-one is forced to use our advertising technologies – they choose to use them because they’re effective.""Judge Mehta held a status conference on Friday as he begins the process of deciding on remedies for Google’s conduct.“The DoJ clearly had a big win, and they’re going to ride that momentum,” Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told the BBC.He said he expects those remedies to involve ""business model tweaks, not a breakup"" of the company.Meanwhile, in Justice Brinkema’s courtroom, the arcane process that governs advertising technology could make the DoJ's attempts to prove its case an uphill climb.“We all use search. We all intuitively understand that product,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.By comparison, advertising technology is “so complex that I think that’s going to be a real challenge for the government to make a clear, simple monopolisation argument here.”The US is not the only country where regulators are unhappy with Google's ad tech business.On Friday, the UK Competition and Markets Authority said it believed Google was abusing its dominance in the ad tech industry, according tothe findings of its initial investigation.It said it found that Google used anti-competitive practices to dominate the market for online advertising technology - and the potentially unlawful behaviour could be harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers.A Google representative said the decision was based on a ""flawed"" understanding of the ad tech sector."
Phone pings around London,"He put his iPhone 13 into lost mode when he got home an hour or so later - meaning the thieves couldn't access its contents - and turned on the Find My iPhone feature using his laptop.This allowed Akara to track his phone's rough location and almost immediately he received a notification to say it was in Islington. Eight days later, the phone was pinging in different locations around north London again.In a move he says he ""wouldn't recommend"" with hindsight, he went to two of the locations his phone had been in to ""look around"".""It was pretty risky,"" he said. ""I was fuelled by adrenaline and anger."" He didn't speak to anyone, but he felt he was being watched and went home.""I am really angry,"" he said. ""The phone is expensive. We work hard to earn that money, to be able to buy the handset, and someone else says 'screw that'.""Then, in May, just over a month after the theft, Akara checked Find My iPhone again - his prized possession was now on the other side of the world - in Shenzhen, China.Akara gave up.It is not uncommon for stolen phones to end up in Shenzhen - where if devices can't be unlocked and used again,they are disassembled for parts.The city is home to 17.6 million people and is a big tech hub, sometimes referred to as China's Silicon Valley."
Police could not help,"In the moments after Akara’s phone was stolen, he saw police officers on the street and he told them what had happened. Officers, he said, were aware of thieves doing a “loop of the area” to steal phones, and he was encouraged to report the offence online, which he did.A few days later, he was told by the Metropolitan Police via email the case was closed as “it is unlikely that we will be able to identify those responsible”.Akara subsequently submitted the pictures and information he had gathered from the locations where his stolen phone had been. The police acknowledged receipt but took no further action.The Metropolitan Police had no comment to make on Akara’s specific case, but said it was “targeting resources to hotspot areas, such as Westminster, Lambeth and Newham, with increased patrols and plain clothes officers which deter criminals and make officers more visibly available to members of the community”."
Lost photos of mum,"Many other people have contacted the BBC with their experiences of having their phones taken. One, James O’Sullivan, 44, from Surrey, says he lost more than £25,000 when thieves used his stolen device's Apple Pay service.Meanwhile, Katie Ashworth, from Newcastle, explained her phone was snatched in a park along with her watch, and a debit card in the phone case.“The saddest thing was that the phone contained the last photos I had of my mum on a walk before she got too unwell to really do anything - I would do anything to get those photos back,"" the 36-year-old says.Again, she says, there was a lack of action from the police.""The police never even followed it up with me, despite my bank transactions showing exactly where the thieves went,"" she said.""The police just told me to check Facebook Marketplace and local second-hand shops like Cex."""
'Battle against the clock' for police,"So why are the police seemingly unable to combat this offence - or recover stolen devices?PC Mat Evans, who has led a team working on this kind of crime for over a decade within West Midlands Police, admitted that only ""quite a low number"" of phones that are stolen actually get recovered.He says the problem is the speed with which criminals move.""Phones will be offloaded to known fences within a couple of hours,"" he said.""It's always a battle against the clock immediately following any of these crimes, but people should always report these things to the police, because if we don't know that these crimes are taking place, we can't investigate them.""And sometimes just one arrest can make a difference.""When we do catch these criminals, either in the act or after the fact, our crime rates tank,"" he said.""Quite often that individual has been responsible for a huge swathe of crime."" But the problem is not just about policing.In a statement, Commander Richard Smith from the National Police Chiefs' Council, which brings together senior officers to help develop policing strategy, said it would ""continue to target"" the most prolific criminals.""We know that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem,"" he said.""Manufacturers and the tech industry have an important role in reducing opportunities for criminals to benefit from the resale of stolen handsets."""
Tracking and disabling,"Stolen phones can already be tracked and have their data erased through services such as ""Find My iPhone"" and ""Find My Device"", from Android.But policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said this week the government wanted manufacturers to ensure that any stolen phone could be permanently disabled to prevent it being sold second-hand.Police chiefs will also be tasked with gathering more intelligence on who is stealing phones and where stolen devices end up.A growing demand for second-hand phones, both in the UK and abroad, is believed to be a major driver behind the recent rise in thefts, the government said.The Home Office is to host a summit at which tech companies and phone manufacturers will be asked to consider innovations that could help stop phones being traded illegally. PC Evans said there was ""no magic bullet"", but he said there was one thing manufacturers could do which would be ""enormously helpful"" to the police - more accurate tracking.""At this moment in time, phone tracking is okay,"" he said.""But it's not that scene in Total Recall yet, where you're able to run around with a tracking device in your hand, sprinting down the road after a little bleeping dot.""I appreciate it's a big ask from the phone companies to make that a thing, but that would be enormously helpful from a policing perspective.""Apple and Android did not provide the BBC with a statement, but Samsung said it was ""working closely with key stakeholders and authorities on the issue of mobile phone theft and related crimes"".Additional reporting by Tom Singleton"
'Instant music ;)',"According to theindictment, Mr Smith was at points operating as many as 10,000 active bot accounts to stream his AI-generated tracks.It is alleged that the tracks in question were provided to Mr Smith through a partnership with the chief executive of an unnamed AI music company, who he turned to in or around 2018.The co-conspirator is said to have supplied him with thousands of tracks a month in exchange for track metadata, such as song and artist names, as well as a monthly cut of streaming revenue.""Keep in mind what we're doing musically here... this is not 'music,' it's 'instant music' ;),"" the executive wrote to Mr Smith in a March 2019 email, and disclosed in the indictment.Citing further emails obtained from Mr Smith and fellow participants in the scheme, the indictment also states the technology used to create the tracks improved over time - making the scheme harder for platforms to detect.In an email from February, Mr Smith claimed his ""existing music has generated at this point over 4 billion streams and $12 million in royalties since 2019.""Mr Smith faces decades in prison if found guilty of the charges.Earlier this year a man in Denmark was reportedly handed an 18-month sentence after being found guilty offraudulently profiting from music streaming royalties.Music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube generally forbid users from artificially inflating their number of streams to gain royalties and have taken steps to clamp down on or advised users on how to avoid the practice.Underchanges to its royalties policiesthat took effect in April, Spotify said it would charge labels and distributors per track if it detected artificial streams of their material.It also increased the number of streams a track needs in a 12 month period before royalties can be paid, and extended the minimum track length for noise recordings like white noise tracks."
Wider concerns,"The wider rise of AI-generated music, and the increased availability of free tools to make tracks, have added to concerns for artists and record labels about getting their fair share of profits made on AI-created tracks.Tools that can create text, images, video, audio in response to prompts are underpinned by systems that have been ""trained"" on vast quantities of data, such as online text and images scraped, often indiscriminately, from across the web.Content that belongs to artists or is protected by copyright has been swept up to form part of some of the training data for such tools.This has sparked outrage for artists across creative industries who feel their work is being used to generate seemingly novel material without due recognition or reward.Platforms rushed to removea track that cloned the voices of Drake and The Weekndin 2023 after it went viral and made its way onto streaming services.Earlier this year, artists including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Elvis Costello and Aerosmith signed an open lettercalling for the end to the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry."
Trump's New York speech,"But Trump has indicated he is serious about working with the outspoken SpaceX and Tesla boss should he retake the White House in November.“When Elon started the conversation with the president, I think the president was very excited that somebody like Elon Musk is so dedicated to America’s future that he would be willing to be a part of something to help the government work more efficiently,” Mr Hughes told reporters on Thursday, according to CNBC.The former president made his announcement in New York before a high-profile, members-only group of business leaders.Founded in 1907, the Economics Club of New York has hosted speeches from figures such as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Trump last addressed the group in 2019, where he received a warm reception.The former president mostly focused on the economy.He repeated calls to cut taxes and regulation, open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and said he would raise tariffs to promote US manufacturing – at one point promising to restore auto industry employment to its peak decades ago.He also proposed an especially low tax rate of 15% for companies that make products in the US, in contrast to the 20% general rate he proposed for companies. His opponent Kamala Harris has suggested a 28% rate.Trump brushed off concerns that tax cuts might worsen the US budget deficit, saying the US would “make our money back on growth” and proposed creating a national investment fund with money collected from tariffs.The audience was largely quiet, though many attendees clapped when Trump discussed Mr Musk’s endorsement.During a question-and-answer session, Trump was asked if he would roll back sanctions to Russia, which he did not specifically address.He did say, however, that he believes the Biden administration has used the tool too widely in general.Trump said he prefers to use sanctions for short periods and “as little as possible”, so that countries are not encouraged to seek out international alternatives to the US financial system and the dollar."
What to do if your phone is stolen,"If your phone is stolen, you should contact the police and provide them your IMEI number - a 15-digit code unique to your device. It is also likely you will need this for an insurance claim.It will be often be printed on the label on your device's box, and most mobile providers can give you this information if you contact them.You can also get this information ahead of any incidents by dialling *#06# on your phone, and many modern operating systems include this information in the settings menu.You should tell your network provider, so they can cancel your Sim card and prevent thieves using your device.While it may not be the first thing that comes to mind, you should also let your bank know - so thieves can't use your mobile banking app. While this is less common, thieves sometimes target people by watching them login to online banking to glean their password, before stealing their device.If you use two-factor authentication, you should remove your phone as a trusted device, and you might consider changing your email passwords too.But it's worth remembering that while this is all good practice to keep your data safe, in the vast majority of cases thieves are more interested in selling your device for profit on the second-hand market, rather than accessing your data."
Disabling devices,"Both iPhone and Android devices have protections against theft.On an iPhone you can use ""Find My iPhone"" to locate your device, providing you have turned it on before it was lost or stolen. You can then login to iCloud on a computer and track your phone.  If it has been stolen, you can secure it and erase all your data.Meanwhile Android has ""Find My Device"" which operates similarly, allowing you to lock your phone and erase your data remotely. Samsung users have a similar tool called ""SmartThings Find"".In these lost modes, Android and iPhone devices cannot be easily unlocked and used again, but thieves are always looking for new ways to bypass these protections.Android 10+ users worldwide will soon receive a feature called Theft Detection Lock, which will use Google's AI to figure out if your phone has been stolen - and lock the device down.It does this by recognising how a phone moves and shakes if it's been snatched out of somebody's hand and speedily taken away.Such a device can still be unlocked if someone knows the phone's PIN or password, while if it triggers by accident it can be unlocked by fingerprint or face scan as normal.Google is also rolling out an upgrade to how a phone is reset to factory settings, to make it so a device can only be set up again by using the device's password.The government wants phone companies to make sure that stolen devices cannot be resold on the second-hand market.Network operators blacklist the IMEI of devices which are reported stolen, meaning they generally speaking cannot be resold in the UK.Because of this, thieves will often send stolen devices overseas to be resold in other countries where the IMEI has not been blocked.Stopping this would require some kind of truly permanent lock to make a device completely unusable for good after it's reported stolen - presumably involving phone companies making it so a device cannot even be turned on once it's reported stolen."
'A systematic and organised process',"The BBC has viewed the descriptions of a number of these chatrooms. One calls for members to post more than four photos of someone along with their name, age and the area they live in.“I was shocked at how systematic and organised the process was,” said Ms Ko. “The most horrific thing I discovered was a group for underage pupils at one school that had more than 2,000 members.”In the days after Ms Ko’s article was published, women’s rights activists started to scour Telegram too, and follow leads.By the end of that week, more than 500 schools and universities had been identified as targets. The actual number impacted is still to be established, but many are believed to be aged under 16, which is South Korea's age of consent. A large proportion of the suspected perpetrators are teenagers themselves.Heejin said learning about the scale of the crisis had made her anxiety worse, as she now worried how many people might have viewed her deepfakes. Initially she blamed herself. “I couldn’t stop thinking did this happen because I uploaded my photos to social media, should I have been more careful?”Scores of women and teenagers across the country have since removed their photos from social media or deactivated their accounts altogether, frightened they could be exploited next.“We are frustrated and angry that we are having to censor our behaviour and our use of social media when we have done nothing wrong,” said one university student, Ah-eun, whose peers have been targeted.Ah-eun said one victim at her university was told by police not to bother pursuing her case as it would be too difficult to catch the perpetrator, and it was “not really a crime” as “the photos were fake”. At the heart of this scandal is the messaging app Telegram. The app is known for having a ‘light touch’ moderation stance and has been accused of not doing enough to police content and particularly groups for years.This has made it aprime space for criminal behaviour to flourish.Last week, politicians and the police responded forcefully, promising to investigate these crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.On Monday, Seoul National Police Agency announced it would look to investigate Telegram over its role in enabling fake pornographic images of children to be distributed.South Korea faces deepfake porn 'emergency'South Korean women protest in Seoul over hidden sex camerasThe app’s founder, Pavel Durov, wascharged in France last weekwith being complicit in a number of crimes related to the app, including enabling the sharing of child pornography.But women's rights activists accuse the authorities in South Korea of allowing sexual abuse on Telegram to simmer unchecked for too long, because Korea has faced this crisis before. In 2019, it emerged that a sex ring was using Telegram to coerce women and children into creating and sharing sexually explicit images of themselves.Police at the time asked Telegram for help with their investigation, but the app ignored all seven of their requests. Although the ringleader was eventually sentenced to more than 40 years in jail, no action was taken against the platform, because of fears around censorship.“They sentenced the main actors but otherwise neglected the situation, and I think this has exacerbated the situation,” said Ms Ko. Park Jihyun, who, as a young student journalist, uncovered the Nth room sex-ring back in 2019, has since become a political advocate for victims of digital sex crimes. She said that since the deepfake scandal broke, pupils and parents had been calling her several times a day crying.“They have seen their school on the list shared on social media and are terrified.”Ms Park has been leading calls for the government to regulate or even ban the app in South Korea. “If these tech companies will not cooperate with law enforcement agencies, then the state must regulate them to protect its citizens,” she said.Before this latest crisis exploded, South Korea’s Advocacy Centre for Online Sexual Abuse victims (ACOSAV) was already noticing a sharp uptick in the number of underage victims of deepfake pornography.In 2023 they counselled 86 teenage victims. That jumped to 238 in just the first eight months of this year. In the past week alone, another 64 teen victims have come forward.One of the centre’s leaders, Park Seonghye, said over the past week her staff had been inundated with calls and were working around the clock. “It’s been a full scale emergency for us, like a wartime situation,” she said.“With the latest deepfake technology there is now so much more footage than there used to be, and we’re worried it’s only going to increase.”As well as counselling victims, the centre tracks down harmful content and works with online platforms to have it taken down. Ms Park said there had been some instances where Telegram had removed content at their request. “So it’s not impossible,” she noted.In a statement, Telegram told the BBC that its moderators “proactively monitor public parts of the app, use AI tools and accept user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of content each day that breach Telegram's terms of service”.While women’s rights organisations accept that new AI technology is making it easier to exploit victims, they argue this is just the latest form of misogyny to play out online in South Korea.First women were subjected to waves of verbal abuse online. Then came the spy cam epidemic, where they were secretly filmed using public toilets and changing rooms.""The root cause of this is structural sexism and the solution is gender equality,” read a statement signed by 84 women’s groups.This is a direct criticism of the country’s President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has denied the existence of structural sexism, cut funding to victim support groups and is abolishing the government’s gender equality ministry. Lee Myung-hwa, who treats young sex offenders, agreed that although the outbreak of deepfake abuse might seem sudden, it had long been lurking under the surface. “For teenagers, deepfakes have become part of their culture, they’re seen as a game or a prank,” said the counsellor, who runs the Aha Seoul Youth Cultural Centre.Ms Lee said it was paramount to educate young men, citing research that shows when you tell offenders exactly what they have done wrong, they become more aware of what counts as sexual abuse, which stops them from reoffending.Meanwhile, the government has said it will increase the criminal sentences of those who create and share deepfake images, and will also punish those who view the pornography.It follows criticism that not enough perpetrators were being punished. One of the issues is that the majority of offenders are teenagers, who are typically tried in youth courts, where they receive more lenient sentences.Since the chatrooms were exposed, many have been closed down, but new ones will almost certainly take their place. A humiliation room has already been created to target the journalists covering this story. Ms Ko, who broke the news, said this had given her sleepless nights. “I keep checking the room to see if my photo has been uploaded,” she said.Such anxiety has spread to almost every teenage girl and young woman in South Korea. Ah-eun, the university student, said it had made her suspicious of her male acquaintances.“I now can’t be certain people won’t commit these crimes behind my back, without me knowing,” she said. “I’ve become hyper-vigilant in all my interactions with people, which can’t be good.”Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Suhnwook Lee"
'My friend needed a reality check',"TikTok told the BBC it has “industry-leading” safety settings for teens and employs more than 40,000 people working to keep users safe. It said this year alone it expects to invest “more than $2bn (£1.5bn) on safety”, and of the content it removes for breaking its rules it finds 98% proactively.Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it has more than 50 different tools, resources and features to give teens “positive and age-appropriate experiences”.Cai told the BBC he tried to use one of Instagram’s tools and a similar one on TikTok to say he was not interested in violent or misogynistic content - but he says he continued to be recommended it.He is interested in UFC - the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He also found himself watching videos from controversial influencers when they were sent his way, but he says he did not want to be recommended this more extreme content.“You get the picture in your head and you can't get it out. [It] stains your brain. And so you think about it for the rest of the day,” he says.Girls he knows who are the same age have been recommended videos about topics such as music and make-up rather than violence, he says. Meanwhile Cai, now 18, says he is still being pushed violent and misogynistic content on both Instagram and TikTok.When we scroll through his Instagram Reels, they include an image making light of domestic violence. It shows two characters side by side, one of whom has bruises, with the caption: “My Love Language”. Another shows a person being run over by a lorry.Cai says he has noticed that videos with millions of likes can be persuasive to other young men his age.For example, he says one of his friends became drawn into content from a controversial influencer - and started to adopt misogynistic views.His friend “took it too far”, Cai says. “He started saying things about women. It’s like you have to give your friend a reality check.”Cai says he has commented on posts to say that he doesn’t like them, and when he has accidentally liked videos, he has tried to undo it, hoping it will reset the algorithms. But he says he has ended up with more videos taking over his feeds. So, how do TikTok’s algorithms actually work?According to Andrew Kaung, the algorithms' fuel is engagement, regardless of whether the engagement is positive or negative. That could explain in part why Cai’s efforts to manipulate the algorithms weren’t working.The first step for users is to specify some likes and interests when they sign up. Andrew says some of the content initially served up by the algorithms to, say, a 16-year-old, is based on the preferences they give and the preferences of other users of a similar age in a similar location.According to TikTok, the algorithms are not informed by a user’s gender. But Andrew says the interests teenagers express when they sign up often have the effect of dividing them up along gender lines.The former TikTok employee says some 16-year-old boys could be exposed to violent content “right away”, because other teenage users with similar preferences have expressed an interest in this type of content - even if that just means spending more time on a video that grabs their attention for that little bit longer.The interests indicated by many teenage girls in profiles he examined - “pop singers, songs, make-up” - meant they were not recommended this violent content, he says.He says the algorithms use “reinforcement learning” - a method where AI systems learn by trial and error - and train themselves to detect behaviour towards different videos.Andrew Kaung says they are designed to maximise engagement by showing you videos they expect you to spend longer watching, comment on, or like - all to keep you coming back for more.The algorithm recommending content to TikTok's “For You Page”, he says, does not always differentiate between harmful and non-harmful content.According to Andrew, one of the problems he identified when he worked at TikTok was that the teams involved in training and coding that algorithm did not always know the exact nature of the videos it was recommending.“They see the number of viewers, the age, the trend, that sort of very abstract data. They wouldn't necessarily be actually exposed to the content,” the former TikTok analyst tells me.That was why, in 2022, he and a colleague decided to take a look at what kinds of videos were being recommended to a range of users, including some 16-year-olds.He says they were concerned about violent and harmful content being served to some teenagers, and proposed to TikTok that it should update its moderation system.They wanted TikTok to clearly label videos so everyone working there could see why they were harmful - extreme violence, abuse, pornography and so on - and to hire more moderators who specialised in these different areas. Andrew says their suggestions were rejected at that time.TikTok says it had specialist moderators at the time and, as the platform has grown, it has continued to hire more. It also said it separated out different types of harmful content - into what it calls queues - for moderators. Panorama: Can We Live Without Our Phones?What happens when smartphones are taken away from kids for a week? With the help of two families and lots of remote cameras, Panorama finds out. And with calls for smartphones to be banned for children, Marianna Spring speaks to parents, teenagers and social media company insiders to investigate whether the content pushed to their feeds is harming them.Watch on Monday on BBC One at 20:00 BST (20:30 in Scotland) oron BBC iPlayer(UK only)"
'Asking a tiger not to eat you',"Andrew Kaung says that from the inside of TikTok and Meta it felt really difficult to make the changes he thought were necessary.“We are asking a private company whose interest is to promote their products to moderate themselves, which is like asking a tiger not to eat you,” he says.He also says he thinks children’s and teenagers’ lives would be better if they stopped using their smartphones.But for Cai, banning phones or social media for teenagers is not the solution. His phone is integral to his life - a really important way of chatting to friends, navigating when he is out and about, and paying for stuff.Instead, he wants the social media companies to listen more to what teenagers don’t want to see. He wants the firms to make the tools that let users indicate their preferences more effective.“I feel like social media companies don't respect your opinion, as long as it makes them money,” Cai tells me.In the UK, a new law will force social media firms to verify children’s ages and stop the sites recommending porn or other harmful content to young people. UK media regulator Ofcom is in charge of enforcing it. Almudena Lara, Ofcom's online safety policy development director, says that while harmful content that predominantly affects young women - such as videos promoting eating disorders and self-harm - have rightly been in the spotlight, the algorithmic pathways driving hate and violence to mainly teenage boys and young men have received less attention.“It tends to be a minority of [children] that get exposed to the most harmful content. But we know, however, that once you are exposed to that harmful content, it becomes unavoidable,” says Ms Lara.Ofcom says it can fine companies and could bring criminal prosecutions if they do not do enough, but the measures will not come in to force until 2025.TikTok says it uses “innovative technology” and provides “industry-leading” safety and privacy settings for teens, including systems to block content that may not be suitable, and that it does not allow extreme violence or misogyny.Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, says it has more than “50 different tools, resources and features” to give teens “positive and age-appropriate experiences”. According to Meta, it seeks feedback from its own teams and potential policy changes go through robust process."
Clone wars,"But how was Lovo able to recreate their voices? The couple alleges it was done under false pretences.Lovo co-founder Tom Lee has previously said its voice-cloning software only needs a user to read about 50 sentences to create a faithful clone.""We can capture the tone, the character, the style, the phonemes, and even if you have an accent, we can capture that as well,"" he told the Future Visionaries podcast in 2021.In their lawsuit, the couple set out how they say Lovo obtained just such a recording from them.They allege anonymous Lovo employees contacted them to record audio assets on Fiverr, the popular freelance talent website, where they were selling their services to provide audio for television, radio, video games, and other media.First, in 2019, Ms Sage says a user reached out asking for her to record dozens of generic sounding test radio scripts.Test recordings are often used in film and television for focus groups, internal meetings, or as placeholders for works in progress. Because they won’t be shared broadly, these recordings cost much less than audio meant for broadcast.Ms Sage says she completed the job, delivered the files, and was paid $400 (£303).About six months later, Mr Lehrman says he got a similar request to record dozens of generic sounding radio ads. In messages the couple have shared with the BBC, the anonymous Fiverr user says the audio will be used for research into ""speech synthesis"".After asking the user to guarantee that the scripts will not be used outside their specific research project, Mr Lehrman asks what the goal of the project is.""The scripts will not be used for anything else,"" the user says, ""and I can't yet tell you the goal, as it's a confidential work in process sorry haha"".Mr Lehrman asked if the finished files would be repurposed or used in a different order. The user says the files will be used for research purposes only. Mr Lehrman says he delivered the files and was paid $1200.The link between the anonymous user and Lovo came, they say, from Lovo itself.They shared the evidence they had found of their voices being cloned with Lovo - who replied they had done nothing wrong, pointing to the communications between them the anonymous user as evidence they engaged with the couple legally.“In our careers, we've delivered over 100,000 audio assets,” Mr Lehrman said, of their work on Fiverr over the better part of a decade.“We were able to find this needle in a haystack - they gave us this needle in a haystack.”In both cases, both Mr Lehrman and Ms Sage say they did not have a written contract, just these conversations. The BBC has not been able to verify the entirety of their conversations. The couple say the user they spoke with also appears to have deleted some messages.The BBC contacted Lovo on several occasions to request an interview with Mr Lee and to seek a response to the couple’s claims. They did not respond to any of our messages."
What does the law say?,"The lawsuit the couple filed in May alleges that Lovo used recordings of their voices to create copies that illegally compete with Ms Sage and Mr Lehrman’s real voices.The couple say the company did so without permission or proper compensation.It is a class action lawsuit - meaning they are hoping other claimants will join it, though none have so far.Professor Kristelia Garcia, an expert in intellectual property law at Georgetown University in Washington DC says the case is likely to centre on an area of US law called rights of publicity.Sometimes referred to as personality rights, violations of one’s publicity often come from misuse or misrepresentation of someone’s image or voice.She also says there could likely be a breach of contract regarding the licences Ms Sage and Mr Lehrman granted the user who commissioned the recordings.""Licences are permission for a very specific and narrow use. I might give you a licence to use my swimming pool one afternoon, but that doesn’t mean you can come whenever you want and have a party in my swimming pool,"" she told the BBC.""That would exceed the terms of the licence.""Whatever the outcome of the case, it is another in a long list of lawsuits brought by artists, authors, illustrators, and musicians who don't want to lose control of their work and livelihood.And they are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg. This week the financial firm Klarna said itplanned to use AI to halve its workforce.Some experts predict40% of all jobswill eventually be impacted by AIFor Mr Lehrman and Ms Sage though that worrying future is playing out now.""This whole experience has felt so surreal,"" Ms Sage said.""When we thought about artificial intelligence, we were thinking of AI folding our laundry and making us dinner, not pursuing human being’s creative endeavours.""You can hear more on this story onTech Life, on BBC Sounds."
Child abuse material,"Telegram says that its moderation is “within industry standards”, but this week we have seen evidence to the contrary related to an area of criminality far less visible (and one I did not search for) - child sexual abuse material.On Wednesday, the BBC learned that while Telegram does respond to some takedown requests from police and charities,it is not participatingin programmes aimed to proactively prevent the spread of images and videos of child sexual abuse.Not doing enough to police child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is one of the chief allegations from French prosecutors.“At the heart of this case is the lack of moderation and co-operation of the platform, in particular in the fight against crimes against children,” said Jean-Michel Bernigaud, the secretary general of French child protection agency Ofmin, on LinkedIn.Telegram told the BBC it does proactively search for illegal activity, including child sexual abuse, on its site. It said undisclosed action was taken against 45,000 groups in August alone.The press office did not respond to follow-up questions about this or anything else in this article."
Not co-operating with police,"Moderation is only part of the problem for Telegram. Its approach to police requests to remove illegal content and pass on evidence is another criticism.As Brian Fishman, a co-founder of Cinder, a software platform for trust and safety, posted: “Telegram is another level: it has been the key hub for Isis for a decade. It tolerates CSAM. It's ignored reasonable law enforcement engagement for years. It’s not 'light' content moderation; it’s a different approach entirely.”Some might argue that Telegram’s privacy features mean that the company does not have much data about this activity to report to police. This is the case with ultra-private apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Telegram offers users similar levels of privacy if they opt to create a “Secret Chat” which uses the same end-to-end encryption that those apps do. It means the activity inside a conversation is completely private and not even Telegram itself can view the contents.However, this function is not set as default on Telegram, and it seems that most of the activity on the app - including on those illicit groups I was added to - are not set as ""secret"". In fact, group chats can't be set as 'Secret' at all.Telegram could read all content and pass it on to police if it wanted to, but it states in its terms and conditions that it does not.“All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them,” the company’s terms and condition read.In June Pavel Durov told journalist Tucker Carlson that he only employs “about 30 engineers” to run his platform.Telegram’s cold approach to law enforcement is something that I have been told about on the fringes of press events by frustrated police officers.French authorities noted in their statements about Mr Durov’s charges that police there and in Belgium had historically an “almost total lack of response from Telegram to legal requests”."
Freedom of speech,"In spite of all the criticism against Telegram’s approach to moderation, there are some who are concerned that Mr Durov’s arrest is a troubling time. Digital rights organisation Access Now says it is watching developments with great concern.In a statement,the campaigners for an open internet said that Telegram is ""no model for corporate responsibility"" and that the group had criticised the app many times in the past.Access Now warns, however, that ""detaining the staff of platforms that people use to exercise their rights to free expression and peaceful assembly, without demonstrable alignment with human rights principles, may result in over-censorship, and could further shrink civic spaces"".Telegram itself has repeatedly said that “it is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of that platform”.Elon Musk, fellow billionaire and owner of X (formerly Twitter), has condemned the arrest and described it as an attack on freedom of speech. He is calling for Mr Durov to be released.So too are some of the criminals on the Telegram groups I am now a member of, with FreeDurov imagery being shared in English and Russian widely."
Who is Pavel Durov?,"Mr Durov is a multi-billionaire who is originally from Russia.He founded the popular Russian social media company VKontakte.In 2014, Mr Durov left Russia after refusing tocomply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.A year earlier, he had founded Telegram and now runs the firm from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he now lives.He holds citizenship of the UAE and France, but Russia has said it still regards him as a citizen.After he was arrested, Telegram said Mr Durov travelled in Europe frequently.In an interview with the conservative US media personality Tucker Carlson in April, Mr Durov said he would refuse certain requests from authorities to remove content from his platform.He said: ""Where we thought it would be crossing the line - it wouldn't be aligning with our values of freedom of speech and protecting people's private correspondence - we would ignore."""
What is Telegram?,"Telegram is one of the world's biggest social media and messaging platforms along with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and WeChat.In July, Mr Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users. It is popular in Russia and Ukraine, while pro-democracy groups in Iran and Hong Kong also use it.Telegram does offer end to end encryption, which means the messages can only be read on the device that sends them and the device that receives them, but this is not the default setting for the user.The big difference between Telegram and similar services like WhatsApp is the size of groups you can be in on Telegram.WhatsApp limits group sizes to 1,000 users whereas up to 200,000 can be in a group on Telegram. The platform has faced criticism that disinformation can spread in these huge groups.Critics have argued the platform has seen the sharing of conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content.In the UK, the app was scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising this month's violent disorder in English cities and cybersecurity experts say its moderation of extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than other social media companies and messenger apps.Following Mr Durov's arrest, Telegram said its moderation ""is within industry standards and constantly improving"".It said it abides by European Union laws, including the Digital Services Act, which aims to ensure a safe and accountable online environment.""Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as means of communication and as a source of vital information,"" the app's statement read.""We’re awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation. Telegram is with you all."""
What has been said about Durov's arrest?,"In Wednesday's statement, the Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was put under formal investigation over alleged offences that included:Complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable illicit transactions by an organised gangRefusal to communicate with authoritiesComplicity in organised criminal distribution of sexual images of childrenIn France, being put under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily result in a trial - but it indicates that judges consider there is enough of a case to proceed with an investigation.Elon Musk, the owner of X, has been defending Mr Durov for several days in a series of posts on his platform, formerly known as Twitter.He said moderation is a “propaganda word” for censorship, and called for Mr Durov's release.Chris Pavlovski, the founder of a controversial video-sharing app called Rumble, said he had fled Europe following Mr Durov’s detention.Earlier this week Edward Snowden, the American whistleblower who now lives in Russia after revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence, said on X that Mr Durov's arrest was ""an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"".He added: ""I am surprised and deeply saddened that [French President Emmanuel] Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications. It lowers not only France, but the world.""After some details of the arrest had emerged, Vyacheslav Volodin - a prominent Russian politician and ally of Vladimir Putin - accused the US of being behind the arrest of Mr Durov.""Telegram is one of the few and at the same time the largest internet platforms over which the United States has no influence,"" he said in a post on the platform.President Macron posted on social media on Monday that he had seen ""false information"" regarding France following Mr Durov’s arrest, and added: ""This is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to decide."""
Union fears,"Klarna - which is based in Sweden, and has two UK offices - disclosed its job-cutting plans as it announced interim results which showed it increased its revenue by 27% to 13.3 billion Swedish krona (£990 million).""Our proven scale efficiencies have been enhanced by our investment in AI, which has driven down operating expenses and improved gross profits,"" it said.It comes as unions have warned of mass job losses amid the growth of AI and are calling for legislation to protect workers.Mr Siemiatkowski  said Klarna would reduce its headcount through what he called ""natural attrition"" - effectively a hiring freeze, where staff aren't replaced after they leave.Typically this means the people that remain are left with an increased workload.But Mr Siemiatkowski contended that AI would be replacing this work, and even claimed it was a potential ""positive development"" for some individuals who may be paid more.While he said it was ""critical"" for government to consider what to do about those who lost their jobs, he suggested there was no ""stopping progress"" for firms like his.""It's important that Europe and democracies are ahead in the evolution of AI,"" he said.Klarna is understood to be shrinking its workforce ahead of a listing on the stock exchange, which has recently been dominated by firms heavily investing in AI, such as Nvidia and Microsoft.This means Klarna being seen as a big proponent of the tech may make its stock more appealing to investors when it does eventually go public."
The future's 'uncertain',"Luke isn't just fast on the virtual track. He says his career is moving at top speed as well.""I started driving with just a £100 steering wheel on the desk and having a bit of fun,"" he says.Not long after, fellow competitors noticed his potential and his parents helped him buy a better simulator.""That’s when things really took off,"" he says.""I joined Team Redline and after that it’s just been up and up and up until this point right now.""Esports tournaments are still ""quite niche and quite new,"" he says.""It’s not been long since all this prize money started coming through and all these big competitions started so there’s not many stories of people going all the way.""In that sense, he's a pioneer, admitting ""the future is a bit uncertain"" for esports champions. But as uncertain as it might be, the industry received another boost last month when it was announced from next yearthere would also be an Olympic Esports Games.Like the Esports World Cup, the Games will be held in Saudi Arabia as part of a 12-year partnership between the Kingdom and the International Olympics Committee.Before the World Cup, players, streamers and fans were divided by the decision for it to be hosted in the Arab country - which also funded the prize pot - due to its record on human rights.Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and it has faced criticism over its stance on LGBT relationships as well as lack of rights for women.Critics condemned it as ""sportswashing"" but the decision was defended by organisers whotold Newsbeat no-one would face discrimination at the event. Luke says the country was ""a really cool setting"" for the event and now has his eye on winning more tournaments and making it to the Olympics - something he says would be ""unbelievable"".""I think I’d find it a bit weird calling myself an Olympian because I really don’t feel like one,"" he says.""But it’s something that would be very cool.""The dream is still the same – we may be world champions but there’s always more.""We want to be world champions in everything, so we’ll keep going."" And if he can be a pioneer in an online esports career, Luke sees no reason he can't be a pioneer offline too.""I hope one day to get into the real world of motorsport,"" he says.""I see more and more people get a way in through sim racing now, and hopefully that does happen.""If not, I’ve got plenty of time to decide what I want to do as I’m still only 19.""

Digital detox,"Some may be sceptical about how truly noble Mr Silberbauer's motives are – and he did concede he would “love” to be able to incorporate a messaging platform like WhatsApp into the Barbie phone.But I spent a day using it and, for now, there is little doubt that as a digital detox it was certainly effective because of its very limited functionality.It is mirror-fronted flip phone and has no app store or touch screen. I had no social media at all, and the phone can not receive anything more advanced than SMS messages.That means no text messages with ""read receipts"" or the function to see when someone is typing. It is the default setting on many smartphones – so I didn’t get many text messages either.Even with predictive text enabled I found the numbers and letters keypad much slower than a touchscreen keyboard and as a result I ended up calling more people than usual, which perhaps was no bad thing.And I discovered there are only so many times you can play the retro Nokia game Snake, even when it’s called Malibu Snake and it's pink.But the handset certainly attracted a lot of attention, especially from girls and young women, as I walked around Glasgow city centre with it.There is of course the danger that instead of being pestered for a smartphone, parents will find themselves being pestered for a piece of Barbie merchandise - which may be just as unwelcome.The phone has a launch price of £99 in the UK – twice what you would pay for a non-branded Nokia feature phone. There are plenty of other phones on the market that offer the same limited functionality, but without any kind of big corporate tie in.""I’d imagine quite a few people will be tempted to buy it as a bit of fun, but in reality, everyone is so dependent on their smartphones that anything more than the odd day of detox will be a stretch,"" says Ben Wood, a phone expert who has his own museum of devices released over the years.Nonetheless, he says, there is a market for what are sometimes called ""dumbphones"". His firm, CCS Insight, estimates that around 400,000 will be sold in the UK this year.""That's an attractive niche for a company like HMD"", he says.Some experts suggest that withdrawing smartphones is no real solution – they are woven into our lives, after all – and instead children need to be taught how to use them in a healthy and safe way.""What we should be doing instead is thinking about, how do we build really good, really long term, sustainable digital literacy skills in that generation,"" says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa university, who has written extensively about the issue of screen time.“I think we could all be better at using our phones in a healthier and more resilient way,"" he said.HMD is also working on a separate project, a new device which it is designing in collaboration with parents. It says more than 1,000 people have signed up to work on it so far.And Mr Silberbaum concedes that the resulting handset may well end up being something that sits somewhere between a dumbphone and a smartphone.“Do I want the smartphone with all the bells and whistles, or do I want to have something that can actually help me have a more considered approach to digital? That's the choice we want to deliver,” he said."
Hunter Biden controversy,"Mr Zuckerberg's comments on Hunter Biden refer to the story of a laptop that was abandoned by the president's son at a repair shop in Delaware - as first reported by the New York Post.The newspaper claimed emails found on the computer suggested his business abroad had influenced US foreign policy while his father was vice-president.The president and his family have denied any wrongdoing.The story became a notable right-wing talking point in the US, and a point of contention as some social media platforms censored the content.Mr Zuckerberg said the story was temporarily demoted on his platforms while going through a fact-check - after a warning from the FBI of a potential Russian disinformation operation, and ""in retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote.""We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again.""Mr Zuckerberg also said he did not plan to make any more contributions to supporting electoral infrastructure.In 2020, he donated $400m (£302m) via his philanthropic Chan Zuckerberg Initiative which was intended to help government offices conduct the election during the pandemic.However, misinformation spread rapidly on social media accusing Mr Zuckerberg of effectively using a loophole to skirt maximum donation limits in a bid to get Mr Biden elected.Mr Zuckerberg said his donations ""were designed to be non-partisan"".""Still, despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other.""My goal is to be neutral and not play a role on way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role - so I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle."""
What is Black Myth about?,"Black Myth: Wukong is a single-player action game where players take on the role of ""the Destined One""- an anthropomorphic monkey with supernatural powers.The Destined One is based on the character of Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King, a key character in Journey to the West.That novel, considered one of the greats of Chinese literature, draws heavily from Chinese mythology as well as Confucianism, Taoist and Buddhist folklore.It has inspired hundreds of international films, TV shows and cartoons, including the popular Japanese anime series Dragon Ball Z and the 2008 Chinese-American fantasy film The Forbidden Kingdom."
Why is Black Myth such a huge hit?,"First announced via a hugely popular teaser trailer in August 2020, Black Myth launched on Tuesday after four years of anticipation.It is the Chinese video game industry’s first AAA release – a title typically given to big-budget games from major companies.High-end graphics,  sophisticated game design and hot-blooded hype have all contributed to its success - as well as the size of China's gaming community, which is the largest in the world.“It's not just a Chinese game targeting the Chinese market or the Chinese-speaking world,” Haiqing Yu, a professor at Australia’s RMIT University, whose research specialises in the sociopolitical and economic impact of China’s digital media, told the BBC.“Players all over the world [are playing] a game that has a Chinese cultural factor.”This has become a huge source of national pride in the country.The Department of Culture and Tourism in Shanxi Province, an area that includes many locations and set pieces featured in the game, released a video on Tuesday that showcased the real-world attractions, triggering a surge in tourism dubbed “Wukong Travel”.Videos posted on TikTok in the wake of Black Myth’s release show tourists flooding temples and shrines featured in the game, in what one X user characterised as a “successful example of cultural rediscovery”.Niko Partners, a company that researches and analyses video games markets and consumers in Asia, similarly pointed out that Black Myth “helps showcase Chinese mythology, traditions, culture and real-life locations in China to the world”."
Why has it sparked controversy?,"Ahead of Black Myth’s release, some content creators and streamers revealed that a company affiliated with its developer had sent them a list of topics to avoid talking about while livestreaming the game: including “feminist propaganda, fetishisation, and other content that instigates negative discourse”. While it is not clear what was precisely meant by “feminist propaganda”, a widely circulatedreport by video game publication IGNin November alleged a history of sexist and inappropriate behaviour from employees of Game Science, the studio behind Black Myth.Other topics designated as “Don'ts” in the document, which has been widely shared on social media and YouTube, included politics, Covid-19, and China’s video game industry policies.The directive, which was sent out by co-publisher Hero Games, has stoked controversy outside China.Multiple content creators refused to review the game, claiming its developers were trying to censor discussion and stifle freedom of speech. Others chose to directly defy the warnings.One creator with the username Moonmoon launched a Twitch stream of Black Myth titled ""Covid-19 Isolation Taiwan (Is a Real Country) Feminism Propaganda"". Another streamer, Rui Zhong, discussed China’s one-child policy on camera while playing the game.On Thursday, Chinese social media platform Weibo banned 138 users who were deemed to be violating its guidelines when discussing Black Myth.According to an article on the state-run Global Times news site, a number of the banned Weibo users were “deviating from discussing the game itself but instead using it as a platform for spreading ‘gender opposition,’ ‘personal attacks’, and other irrational comments”."
Has this affected the game’s success?,"While the controversy has attracted a lot of attention in international media and online, it has not really dented or detracted from Black Myth’s overwhelmingly positive reception.The game made $53m in presales alone, with another 4.5 million copies sold within 24 hours of its release. Within the same timeframe it broke the record for the most-played single-player title ever released on Steam.On platforms like Weibo, Reddit and YouTube, and elsewhere, reams of comments are celebrating the game’s success. Many suggest that the fallout from the controversies surrounding the game’s release has been overblown.Ms Yu agreed, describing Black Myth as an “industry and overall market success”.“When it comes to Chinese digital media and communication platforms, of course people cannot avoid talking about censorship,” she said. “Black Myth is… an example of how to tell the Chinese story well, and how to expand Chinese cultural influence globally. I don't see any censorship there.”She also pointed out that apparent attempts to steer or censor what reviewers said were unlikely to have come from Chinese officials themselves. More likely, Ms Yu suggested, is that the list of ""Dos"" and ""Don'ts"" came from a company that was trying to keep itself out of trouble.“The company issues their notification so if anybody from the central government comes to have a chat with the company, the company can say, ‘look, I already told them. I can't stop people from saying what they want to say.’“They have basically, to use the colloquial term, covered their own ass,” she concluded. “I view it as a politically correct gesture to the Chinese censors, rather than a real directive coming from the top down.”"
You are the product,"There's a common way to understand internet business models: ""If you're getting it for free, you are the product.""What that means in practice is websites give away their content away for free and in return you feed them with your personal data.They then sell that information so you can be targeted with ads more personal to you - and more lucrative for them.But, since 2018, there has been a threat to that model: websites in the UK have had to ask for explicit consent to use cookies and similar tracking technologies.Everyone has become familiar with the pop-up when you visit a site, asking you to ""accept all"" or reject nonessential cookies.The problem for websites is that if you reject tracking they gather less information, which means advertisers pay them less because they as less confident about how well directed their ads are.Which is where ""consent or pay"" comes in - it is an attempt by websites to make up for the money they lose if you say no to your data being collected and sold."
Budget black hole,"One of the industries this particularly affects is the print media, which is largely funded by advertising and paywalls online.But online advertisers have taken their spending elsewhere – on social media sites, influencers and brand deals – leaving a black hole in newspaper budgets.Newspapers such as MailOnline, The Sun, The Independent and The Times have all recently brought in ""consent or pay"" models.""It's basically saying, 'We're giving people a choice. They can either pay and get ad-free access to our articles, or they can be tracked, or they can walk away and not read it,'"" Philippa Donn says. This question being considered by the ICO and others is - is that a fair choice?The idea of freely-given consent has to meet a ""very high bar,"" says Eva Lu, associate at law firm Stephenson Harwood.For Ms Lu, it comes down to whether the user has ""a genuinely free choice to how their personal data should be used by the organisation.""This means that whether or not the model is allowed may come down to a case-by-case basis.The amount users have to pay for privacy may be taken into account.Another factor considered will be the size of the company and if there is an alternative option for users.""If you can't read a certain article, you might just choose not to and you can go read about it somewhere else,"" says Ms Lu.But for other industries, such as film and TV streaming, ""it could be a lot harder to justify,"" she adds.""From a user's perspective, if I want to watch a film or a TV show and it's only available on that streaming service or platform, then that the alternative may not be there elsewhere."" The question has been tested on social media in the EU, where Meta put a ""pay or consent"" policy on Instagram and Facebook.Under this model, Facebook and Instagram still track your behaviour on their apps in order to feed the recommendation alogrithm.But that data is not used to target ads at you.In general in the EU, the tech giants such as Meta are held to higher standards than smaller companies when it comes to regulation.In July, the European Commissioninformed Metathat preliminary findings suggest its ""pay or consent"" model is against EU law.Meta now has the right to review the evidence gathered by the EU and mount a defence.Meta maintains it is acting within the law and ""subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries"".The company is currently in discussions with the ICO, the UK data regulator, about bringing the model to the UK in the future.A company spokesperson says they are ""engaging constructively"" and will share more information in the future. No decisions have been made yet."
From online hobbyist to citizen science,"On his half-acre of land that borders a dry watercourse, Aldrich has three solar-powered trail cameras. Originally popularised by hunters and researchers, trail cameras have infrared light motion sensors that are triggered, ideally, when an animal walks past. ""I set mine to the highest-quality video setting and keep my [motion] sensitivity low because I don't want blades of grass or a bug setting it off,"" Aldrich says. Once a month, Aldrich reviews the footage and edits together a narrated video that he shares onYouTube,Instagramand in a trail cameraReddit group. The regular cast of characters include packs of peccary – an herbivore that resembles a wild boar, also known as a javelina – deer, rabbits, coyotes, quail and nectar-feeding bats. But it was Aldrich's footage of a bobcat in a radio collar that cemented his status as an honorary research assistant.  ""Scientists from theBobcats in Tucson Projectsaw my footage and said, 'That's our bobcat.' They put traps around my property and captured this bobcat to switch out her collar. I got to hold her and help the scientists with their research,"" he says. While most critter cam enthusiasts will never get to hold a wild animal, collected footage from civilians can be a real asset to conservationists. ""We need eyes on the ground,"" says Anne Clark, a behavioural ecologist at Binghamton University, New York. ""Increasingly scientists are realising that they can get help from avid and careful [amateur] observers, particularly those with a little technology out there."" A group of volunteers trained through a programme atMississippi State Universitydid just that in astudy that used 1,000 trail camsacross the US to monitor the impacts of gentrification and green infrastructure on urban wildlife. One eye-opening finding was that gentrified areas on the east coast, where money had been invested in landscaping and gardens, attracted a larger population of ""non-nuisance species"" like deer, rabbit and foxes. Meanwhile, underserved urban communities on the west coast with less green infrastructure attracted more ""nuisance"" species like rats, skunks and raccoons. The study's co-authors say more research is needed to understand why the regions differ, but scientists agree that when there's more green space, biodiversity flourishes. Backyard trail cams can unveil secrets about plants as well, according to Nina Zitani, an assistant professor of biology at Western University in Canada who coined the term ""biodiversity gardening"". In many cases, ""we don't know the types of pollinators that plants are dependent on"", Zitani says. ""Trail cameras help us make interesting observations about which animals are eating the fruit and dispersing the seed, which is really important for plant reproduction. We tend to focus on animals, but we won't have any animals if we don't have native plants."""
Instagram's wildest new stars,"Of course, not every animal spy wants to be a scientist. Plenty of folks just enjoy peering into a secret world. That's the case for David and Johanna Kaye in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The couple have two wi-fi-enabled outdoor cameras that make them feel more connected to the world and provide hours of entertainment. ""It's fun to know who your critter neighbours are, and I've given them names,"" Johanna says. ""The fox is Le Slinkus and the skunk is Le Stinkus. There's also a calico cat I call The Inspector because it's always checking everything."" Anthropomorphising is part of the appeal, especially for Caitlyn Montgomery, a Los Angeles-based photographer. Montgomery initially set up her trail camera to clock who the culprit eating her garden was but came up empty. During the California fire season, however, she set out water in front of the camera. Later, she saw that birds had hopped in to cool off. ""These birds were splashing around in the bowls, living their best lives, and it really just brought me joy,"" she says. Montgomery's husband – a photographer and set builder – suggested they craft a mini film set for the birds. ""He made this tiny picnic table and a little hot tub out of stuff we had around the house. Then he stuck the props to a board with the camera mounted on one side,"" she says. Eventually, Montgomery upgraded to a better camera and added seasonal décor, like wee Christmas trees, Thanksgiving pies, Halloween pumpkins, a string of hearts for Valentine's Day and a teeny bottle of champagne for New Year's. To her surprise, coyotes, skunks and opossums happened by and destroyed a few props, which tended to shatter the illusion. ""When a coyote comes, you can see how small the table is and it messes with your perspective,"" she says. Soon after, Montgomery launched an account onInstagram. Though she's only amassed a few hundred followers, the birds and larger animals have some dedicated fans. Montgomery enjoys being a part of the critter cam community, but she has complicated feelings about social media. ""I have to remind myself that this isn't about likes."""
The secret lives of animals,"As always, social media can be a struggle, particularly for creative folks who worry that every post will be scrutinised by critics. It's one of the reasons Montgomery set up a feed for the footage separate from her personal account, allowing her to spotlight the sweetness of the animals and make it less about herself. LouAnne Brickhouse, a storyteller who’s amassed 223,000 Instagram followers on her garden trail cameraaccount, felt similarly skittish about social media at first. ""I find it to be so competitive and a race to be interesting, but those negative feelings were taken away by the community on [my account] because it's like this big family,"" she says. In 2015, Brickhouse built a bird bath in her yard in Los Angeles's Studio City neighbourhood, and two ravens immediately swooped down to test the waters. ""I was utterly mesmerised, charmed and blown away at how magnificent these two ravens were,"" she recalls. ""I would leave out nuts and the male raven started coming back every day and would knock on my window."" If Brickhouse wasn't in the room, the raven would knock harder. ""He understood the gradations of sound and how it summons a human,"" she says. Brickhouse named the ravens James and Margaret as an homage to thehistoric 1970 conversationbetween writer James Baldwin and celebrity anthropologist Margaret Mead. ""That conversation about understanding each other collectively even though they came from very different places made such an impression on me, and it's how I felt when James [the raven] basically introduced me to his world and his point of view."" Brickhouse launched her feed using videos of James taken with her phone. Three years later, she put up a few wi-fi-enabled security cameras to see who else might be stopping by. ""Once I started watching the footage, I was in awe of how many lives were being lived right outside."" She now has 50 cameras around her property and, because the small devices can fit inside nesting boxes, they literally bring her closer to nature. ""I can see eggs being laid in nest boxes,"" she says. ""I can see little babies growing up and the parent going in every 30 seconds to feed them. I see squirrels curling up in a box to sleep while we're asleep. As different as they are, we're not that different."" Interspecies empathy is the guiding principle of Brickhouse's feed. When she shares footage of Stevie and Jack, a pair of visiting coyotes that play with dog toys, or Scout, the vulture flaunting her feathers, Brickhouse hopes to clear up misconceptions about wildlife. ""I started posting the vultures and people said, 'Oh, they're so ugly. They're a bad sign.' But now they see, and they've learned,"" she says. ""When I go outside and talk to Scout or her mother, Mildred the Magnificent, it's like an old friend, and a magical one at that."" (Read more aboutwhy we should value scavengers such as vultures)."
"Up with trail cameras, down with stress","Like Brickhouse's feed, most online critter cam groups are supportive spaces for animal enthusiasts to connect and share knowledge. There's also an activeReddit communitywtih 222,000 members, where critter sleuths help each other identify mystery species from uploaded videos, photos and audio. On the flip side, some cam communities are dedicated entirely to hunting. In fact, most trail cameras are made by gun companies. That didn't thrill Nick Walsh – a newly-minted animal spy in Sherman Oaks, California. ""I went on Amazon and typed in 'critter cam', and nothing came up. All the cameras are very bulky and hunty, and not cute or fun. It's not made for our needs,"" he says. More like this:•The animals that will survive climate change•In Portugal’s Montesinho, shepherds peacefully coexist alongside wolves•The human-like “alphabet” of whales There is change afoot, however. ""You've got an aging demographic, and they're hanging up their hunting hats,"" says Rich Howell, the founder and chief executive of TrailCamPro.com, a website that works to sell, rate and review every make of trail camera. ""The hunting industry is shrinking, and more people are using trail cameras for wildlife observation on their property."" While that might not be great for the hunting business, Howell says that one-third of his customers are buying the cameras for critter spying and that segment is growing. That may be good news not just for the critter cam crowd, but the world at large. A2023 studyconcluded that watching a nature video can be just as beneficial as taking a walk outside when it comes to stress reduction, relaxation and mood elevation. Montgomery believes that by watching footage of critters coming together, sharing resources and coexisting, we're reminded that the natural world flourishes beyond our concerns and worries. ""These animals are just out there surviving, and they don't care about me,"" Montgomery says. ""There's something really grounding about that. I can be kind of an anxious doing-a-million-things kind of person, and it just slows me down to go out there in the morning and see who's stopped by."" As for me, I just added a second camera to double my dose of dopamine. With the state of the world right now, it felt like a very worthwhile investment. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.
